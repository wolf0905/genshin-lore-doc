It appears that these books were left behind by an ancient order... Kingdoms rise and fall, and when a civilization is annihilated, a new one will be born after from the ashes, which these books refer to as \"Fortuna\"... It's somewhat rudimentary, but theoretically at least, it bears striking resemblance to the computational scheme I have formulated and termed \"world-formula\"... ...All the records are blurred with age. But were I able to quantify them to some extent, they could be of use in my \"world-formula\" calculations...  </p> <p>...No matter how many times I derive it, the result remains the same, though this result is not expected... Unlike the world depicted in these ancient texts, there will be no more new civilizations born... Unless we consider introducing \"variables\" from outside the system... If it was that sort of power, there might be a chance...  </p> <p></p> <p>Here I found the magical techniques left behind by the Golden Troupe (they seem to be referred to by various names, I'll go with this one for now). Based on my interpretation, it appears to be known as the \"Seal of Chymical Marriage\" and consists of two parts. However, it has been weathered too much to decipher any more information... Interestingly, I have encountered similar symbols in documents from the Narzissenkreuz Institute archives... They look complicated, yet the underlying principles are quite clear. If the records prove accurate, there are some key locations within the realm remaining... Related records may be found elsewhere as well... I should record my findings here for now, as they may prove useful in the future...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Book_of_Revealing/#enigmatic-page-ii","title":"Enigmatic Page (II)","text":"<p>...The pollution of the land and water wrought by the giant beast Elynas seems to have been mostly purified and diluted. However, when it comes to Elynas itself, even the adults seem to be at a total loss. They simply cordoned off the surrounding area. Nevertheless, it was quite easy to sneak in. It felt rather strange slipping into the creature's mouth, and it reminded me of events from some of the stories I once read...  </p> <p>...Though I have no substantive evidence, I still sensed some sort of \"will\" from it. Jakob did, too... There were no signs of decay in the flesh. Instead, its body was hardening, as if forming a protective membrane. Given its current immobilized state, it looked like a self-defense mechanism to safeguard its internal organs... ...But it does make sense, with such a wellspring of vitality... If my deduction is correct, it may also be used to enhance Jakob's strength by following the same principle... However, at this stage, there's no need to subject Jakob to such risks. I should get safe experimental data first through the Institute of Natural Philosophy, and then set specific research objectives. Although, as Jakob mentioned, this may waste a lot of precious time... ...After all, the flesh of Elynas remains toxic, and the risk if Jakob...  </p> <p>...Jakob has returned. He's quite brave, but also an idiot. He didn't give any thought to the possible consequences. We have no one else to rely on now. If he... ...The data we've collected is still incomplete. Jakob had minor adverse reactions, primarily vomiting. But he recovered quickly and hasn't shown other symptoms in the short term. His mental status and physical status remain stable... It's only possible because Jakob completely trusts me... Our lives are limited. Still, even if it's just for the future, we must find a way to get allies, get stronger, and prevent disaster...  </p> <p>...Alain has enrolled in the Institute of Natural Philosophy. He should fit right in with his sharp mind. I brought the pocket watch he gave us, and we compared the time only to find there was already a significant discrepancy... We agreed to meet at the Institute. The brightest minds of Fontaine are gathered there, and we can expect to make huge progress and get much-needed help... ...As for Mary-Ann, just the sight of her fills me with joy. We had a long discussion about the Narzissenkreuz Institute, but Jakob was crying through most of it... I didn't tell them about Jakob. It's because Uncle Guillotin, who was with them, is part of the Maison Gardiennage. Although he seems to be treating Alain and Mary-Ann very well, he still can't be trusted.

As before, the flesh and blood of the great beast Elynas is being used as nutrition. Jakob seems to have gotten used to it, so there's nothing to worry about anymore. Thus the \"adverse reactions\" observed before may just have been caused by Jakob's feelings of disgust. It's a relief to know that his physical condition hasn't been harmed... ...Jakob still eats, but only out of habit and no longer as a necessity for survival. But I suppose it's a good thing, because eating together is nice. It suddenly occurred to me that jam was somewhat similar to the flesh and blood of Elynas, so I made a joke about it. Jakob seemed quite uncomfortable... ...The results have improved significantly in comparison to previous tests. Perhaps more can be done... Then the next step would be to attempt the opening of a \"passage\"...  </p> <p>...The \"passage\" was opened successfully, though it only lasted a short while. During this time, many black monsters that were shaped like dogs emerged. They were very aggressive and terrifying, but thank goodness Jakob was here. Though he was so scared he was crying, he still managed to wipe them out while bawling... ...These monsters are identical to those we discovered during our desert expedition. However, those were salt gray, stiff, and immobile at the time, so it was relatively safe... ...I'm certain their properties are nearly identical to those of Elynas...  </p> <p>...The Khaenri'ahn records mention \"passages\" appearing in large numbers, and numerous dangerous monsters that looked like dogs emerging from them. It's very likely that they are the same type... ...It can be safely postulated that the location these \"passages\" link to is full of these monsters, and I shall tentatively call them \"Beastly Rifts\"... thus, these hounds may be called \"Rifthounds\"...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Book_of_Revealing/#enigmatic-page-iv","title":"Enigmatic Page (IV)","text":"<p>...I've been assigned to Alain's lab... That guy only likes things he can figure out completely. If this were a novel, he might be the type of villain who becomes a crazed serial killer just to figure out how the human body works. But he doesn't seem even remotely phased about such statements. On the contrary, he spoke to us about the similarities and differences between humans and machines, and between artificial intelligence and personality. Uh-oh, this is bad, at this rate he might really turn into a villain like that...  </p> <p>...I was disappointed to discover that quality of the people from the Institute is worse than I expected. I expected the people here to be smarter and more open to new ideas than those in high positions outside, but the reality has been infuriating. Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it incomprehensible. It stands to reason that a research institution with such vast resources should possess the greatest talent... Alain's assistant isn't very good, a little stupid even. But at the very least, he is not hostile and doesn't fear us...  </p> <p>...I'm unable to get the research resources I desire for now. But that isn't a bad thing. Jakob has always been fond of watching him take apart pocket watches and other clockwork devices... The direction of Alain's research on controlled annihilation isn't bad, and it would be very interesting to figure out the nature of ousia and pneuma. After all, as a form of energy localized to Fontaine that has been observed in living organisms, fully researching them might help us understand the difference in nature between the structure of our bodies and that of Karl's...  </p> <p>...In any case, I must find a way to win over the people here. Though their imagination is limited, and it's unpleasant to say so, they have some influence outside the Institute. Their strength and resources must be consolidated to help them... I can use that book to show them what we've experienced...  </p> <p>...Although they say a single piece of evidence is never sufficient, the change in Jakob fills me with hope. If I can make more people accept this kind of change, then it wouldn't matter even if we came face to face with the apocalypse. Even if our world couldn't even grow mint, we could still survive, and as long as we can survive, we can revive our civilization. That will be the next topic...  </p> <p>...He called it a field investigation from the higher-ups, but I think Carter just wanted to take us out to have some fun! I wonder when he got to know Mary-Ann... Though it's quite nice because I haven't seen such a carefree smile on her face for a long time. The same goes for Jakob and Alain, it's like they were back in the Narzissenkreuz Institute... Of course, I was quite happy too. Based on the ruins here, it's likely to be related to the \"Golden Troupe\"... If that is true, the huge stone figures in the ruins may have significant research value as well... I found a damaged map, it may be useful...  </p> <p>...I just found out about his physical condition. It seems I cannot continue indulging in mechanical research with Alain, and I must find a final solution as soon as possible. Or it will be too late...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Book_of_Revealing/#enigmatic-page-v","title":"Enigmatic Page (V)","text":"<p>...Alain made a huge breakthrough. Everyone is discussing Fontaine's energy revolution. But instead of praise, there seems to be more jealousy drifting around the Institute. Although it has nothing to do with me, I'm still furious on his behalf...  </p> <p>...The adventurer we commissioned found something really valuable, a red gemstone that appeared on the snowy mountains of Mondstadt after the disaster. Its properties are very similar to the flesh and blood of Elynas (verified by Jakob). It's supposedly a product of the great dragon's decaying corpse (in order to reduce confusion, it will hereinafter be referred to as Scarlet Quartz)... Although it generates heat and has the effect of increasing explosive power, the toxins it contains mean ordinary humans cannot withstand it, with the exception of \u2460Neohumans (tentative name) like Jakob \u2461capable of detoxifying it (none have been found yet)... Another similar discovery is the filth in the great mines of Liyue...  </p> <p>...Unfortunately, I've hit a snag in my research. The biggest challenge is how to reproduce results... But if I can obtain sufficient resources, I'm certain I can overcome this... At the very least, the idiots on our side still admire (fear) us. The tricks I put Jakob up to were very quite effective... Even though it's quite sad that people from an Institute of Natural Philosophy have somewhat turned into believers, at least I can entrust them with simple tasks... Let's use that name to form a \"society\" for now. I'll use it as a means to give them organization and a sense of belonging...  </p> <p>...But Carter is unconscious. I took samples of his blood and skin and got a swift catspaw to take it to Sumeru to be looked at... other from observing the problem, the root of the problem cannot be found. It's pointless, absolutely pointless. Conventional medicine is pointless. I must figure something else out...  </p> <p>...Jakob... Jakob's proposal is very dangerous. I must give it more thought.  </p> <p>...  </p> <p>...I told Carter everything and had Jakob prove his strength and transformation. I even explained the risks, its historical baggage, and my other objective: To create a second sample that can corroborate the realization of human transcendence via \u2588\u2588, and derive the holistic character and method from it. Carter isn't very good at thinking scientifically, so I used many examples and methods of emphasis.

Or perhaps he's not himself anymore? I can't be sure.  </p> <p>... ...I must continue observing. It can't be a waste. It can't be a waste. Or else it will all have been for nothing, utterly meaningless. I got more materials in an attempt to reverse it. All sorts of relics and biological tissue from after the calamity. I even got my hands on extremely dangerous residue. Nothing worked. But I can't give up. He's still \"alive\" right now. At the very least, in this sense, it can continue. It cannot be a waste.  </p> <p>... ...He's preserved for now and further tissue collapse has been prevented. Jakob doesn't tear up at the sight of him anymore... but occasionally Carter's voice is occasionally heard from... and that's the worst. I've tried cutting out the organs where his vocal cords probably are, but they grow back in one to three days...  </p> <p>... ...Alain and I have completely broken off our working relationship. It's regrettable, but I don't blame him... The most regrettable part is the previous direction was proved to be ineffective, but it wasn't all for naught. Identifying the errors made was the greatest benefit. Due to the short lifespans, the cost of trial and error is very high. On this account, I must thank Carter. So, I must find a way to save him. I must prove that I can do it... Another thing I gained is members of the society have grown more loyal.

He came with no attendants or guards, just a single horse, and a golden-tipped fasces as a symbol of his status. Everyone present was deeply displeased, but the emissary was permitted to speak out of respect for Erinnyes, the beloved leader of the knights.

And who shall save us in our hour of need?\" \"Of all these braves, who has rescued themselves from ignorance and superstition?

It is an anthological work produced over several generations at this point.  </p> <p>This is a story from very ancient times indeed. It is said that in those days, birds had not yet split into domestic and wild kindreds. In those days, a crimson moon shone down upon the subterranean realm, and not the dark sun of latter days. Due to the Kingdom's unique position, things from outside this world were always leaking into it. The Kingdom's weapons would wipe out the calamities slipping in, but what of all the other objects? Such as, say, a child who may have come from some destroyed world? One of the sages spoke thusly to the great ruler: \"Oh high lord of the nobles, a child once told me a tale of another world: Once upon a time, there were sea people who believed that the gods came from the sea. Each time they discovered a shipwrecked person, they would treat them with the utmost honor, for they believed that the gods would take the form of the shipwrecked to investigate the mortal realm.\" The ruler replied, \"I do not perceive your meaning, so do as you please.\" (Naturally, no oceans in the traditional sense lay within the Kingdom's borders. The earliest founders of the Kingdom had once seen the majestic silhouettes of the mountains blur under the sun's searing glare, and the rippling reflections of the moonlight falling upon the sea's surface like a scattering of pearls. But at the time the story took place, only outsiders and those few who had left the Kingdom on official duties and returned could describe such sights to the ruler. The ocean and the sea were often used as a metaphor for the space projected by the stars.) In anticipation of the arrival at their Kingdom of gods from beyond the so-called ocean \u2014 or rather, the arrival of beings who could transcend the gods \u2014 they founded an organization, an orphanage to take care of such children. In latter days, the orphans of the Kingdom and those who wandered in from outside were accepted as well.  </p> <p>The young Perinheri's first memory was that of being asked by the grown-ups to crawl through a dark corridor. This passage might have been a chimney for winter fires, for it was filled with coal ash, and there was not a single crack in it through which smoke or light could pass through. As he crawled, he would sometimes stumble in the pitch-black darkness. Fortunately, the corridor appeared designed for the passage of children in the first place, so the falls were not very painful. It also lacked any annoying cobwebs. When Perinheri reached the end at last, the exit had not opened yet. He knocked, only for the grown-ups to coldly ask: \"Are you dead?\" Well, how was he to reply if he was dead? But the grown-ups did not like this response. They kept asking the same question, until he at least shouted, \"Yes, I'm dead!\" The adults then asked, \"Did you see it, then?\" Perhaps it was the fear brought on by the darkness combined with hunger and exhaustion, but Perinheri did indeed see an illusion. The crimson moon, hanging high in the pitch-dark night sky, suddenly turned around, revealing itself to be a titanic, horrified eye. The adults opened the door and embraced the soot-covered Perinheri: \"You have traversed the fire of two worlds within the hearth, and here you are reborn.\"  </p> <p>Though the crimson moon set, and the dark sun descended into a yet darker dusk, that transcendental person from beyond who the Kingdom orphanage was awaiting never arrived. But unusual individuals they had aplenty, and many of those who strode forth from the gates of that orphanage became great knights of the Kingdom. Perinheri was, in his time, the leading figure amongst their ranks \u2014 that is, unless, he were forced to compete with his best friend, Hleobrant. They should have competed for glory, and decided who was superior through the amount of honors they crowned themselves in \u2014 and in the number of goblets of fine wine downed during the festivities afterward. But for some reason, their rivalry would take a mortal turn.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Perinheri/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This text is also known as \"Hleobranto Innamorato.\" The author of the first edition claims to have based this tale on a legendary story known throughout Khaenri'ah, but there are none left who can verify this. It is an anthological work produced over several generations at this point.  </p> <p>That day, the orphanage welcomed a new member. She was a beautiful young lady from a foreign land who claimed to be a noble princess. Her nation had been defeated by Deus Auri, and yet the daughter of a priestly line she remained, and would not submit to the new god, and so she had drifted, wandering through the gates of their Kingdom. She called herself Angelica (Note 1), meaning \"one who is as a divine emissary.\" Fair Angelica declared that she would only marry the mightiest knight in all the Kingdom. Perinheri cared not a whit, but Hleobrant was smitten with her. Angelica would often take walks near the Sea of Wells, and there she spoke much of the outside world to Hleobrant. Perinheri would come along out of concern for his friend, and because suspicion was born in him sooner than curiosity, he would doubt her every word, yet wished that he might see these things one day.  </p> <p>Angelica's arrival changed Hleobrant altogether. He would cause trouble, looking for any provocation upon which to stake a duel against other knights. He would win all these bouts, and turn to Angelica to show off his prowess. Yet all she ever gave him was a cool smile, for what great feat was it for a great runner if they raced a tortoise and triumphed? \"Njord, who walks with the Darksprites (Note 2), Alf, the greatest warrior in the Universitas Magistrorum, Alberich, commander of half the knights, and Perinheri the undefeated.\" Angelica spoke thus of the mightiest figures in the Kingdom as she saw them. Having fallen head over heels into the throes of love, Hleobrant came to what was an all-too-reasonable conclusion for himself. People might call him a traitor, or believe him mad. But even so, he had no wish to hurt Perinheri. As for Perinheri, he believed that his best friend's madness would be cured, if only he could kill Angelica.  </p> <p>In the midst of that most merciless of pursuits, the three left the Kingdom's borders. At that very moment, Hleobrant clutched his face, and the words escaping his mouth gradually grew more like the howling of a wild beast. The witch, Angelica, explained thus: \"Hleobrant is the descendant of those who forsook their god and came to the Kingdom. This is why the Kingdom's obstinately pure-blooded aristocracy persists. This is the price of betraying your own god.\" \"As for you, Perinheri, you are one who drifted there. Thus, you bear no such curse. You may not have the nobility to shoulder a world, but you too have your own destiny.\" \"And as for me? I betrayed no one, not for a moment, until my god died, so I too bear this curse not. But you now see who I truly am, yes?\" The sun rose over the horizon at that moment, and Perinheri's blade slipped from his fingers, exhausted from the night-long battle. Covering his forehead with the back of his hand, he looked upon the sun for the first time. And when he glanced back at Angelica, he saw that she was neither a beautiful woman from Liyue nor a wicked witch. \"I am freedom, that which has broken free of fate. This is what Hleobrant sought in agony, but that which is now yours for the taking.\" There was nothing before Perinheri, only vast, empty land. </p> <p>Note 1: Note that the ancient people of Liyue did not use such names.

The long wait was beginning to bore me... \"This is taking too long.

It would be more surprising for someone to not be enamored with the Phantom Thief!\" And just as the journalist was excitedly regaling me with tales of this rogue's \"great deeds,\" the clock struck midnight exactly. Suddenly, there was a great explosion, and the mansion lights died all at once. Before we could adapt to the sudden darkness, a great light blazed forth from the mansion window, rendering the night day for a few moments. Having recovered their sight, the police filed in, and I trailed after, stepping into Mr. Pierre's collection room. There was nothing on the dais \u2014 the Iridescent Starstone Brooch was gone. Both the roars of rage and cries of dismay seemed washed out and meaningless in the face of this obvious truth. The hubbub of the crowd and the remnant sounds of the explosion formed a cacophonic mix that made my head hurt. There was nothing for me to do, so as my uncle instructed, I pretended to investigate the scene before returning home. Before I left, I heard the sound of a shutter behind me, and the lady journalist's most unprofessional gushing: \"Ah! The legendary Phantom Thief Robben makes yet another extravagant exit!

Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend.</p> <p>Legend says there is a sea of ice far off in the south. That is where the penguins live. Penguins are chubby little ladies and gentlemen, with tuxedos of black feathers pulled tight over their cute white bellies. You might think they look awkward on land, waddling about, unable to fly like other birds. But just you wait. You'll see them throw themselves onto those bellies and slide as if snowboarding, right into the water. With a splash, they become elegant and talented swimmers, their thick, flipper-like wings helping to streamline their bodies as they zoom about underwater. Now, lots of children already know these penguin facts. And children who love penguins will know all this by heart. But there is one thing that even the penguin-loving children don't know. Every penguin in the world comes from outer space, far beyond the skies. Great flocks of penguins once flew across the universe, their flippers steering them between the stars, their sleek feathers reflecting what little starlight there was out there in the void. From red giants to white dwarfs, from the shoulder of Orion to the glimmering Tannhauser Gate... The penguins explored it all. The penguins remember it all. But, perhaps because of some interstellar catastrophe or even a simple family argument, several penguin clans split off from that galaxy-roaming flock and landed in the icy waters to the south of Teyvat. They became our first penguins. But those new arrivals found our atmosphere too thick to fly in, and their lack of prior experience with water left them unable to swim as well. Until, that is, the birth of the marvelous Pers the Penguin \u2014 the first penguin to learn to swim.  </p> <p>Like many young penguins, Pers would gaze up at the starry night sky, or the blue skies of daytime, and say to himself: \"If only I could fly, like my ancestors!\"  </p> <p>And so Pers decided to learn from the birds. How did they fly so high? First, Pers the Penguin asked the biggest bird he could find: a frigatebird. And the frigatebird said: \"Haha! Piece of cake! Once you bring me 30 fish, I'll spill the beans!\" And so Pers spent 50 nights on a moonlit beach, collecting 300 shells. Then he found a whale who liked shells and exchanged his 300 shells for 30 fish. The next day, the frigatebird swallowed those 30 fish in one great big gulp before laughing and flying away. As he flew off, he called down to young Pers: \"The secret to flying is to be light! Why not try losing some weight?\" Well, losing weight was easy enough. But if a penguin lost its thick layer of fat, it wouldn't be a penguin anymore. So, Pers shook his head. And as all children know, the frigatebird got a new nickname after all this for its greed and unreasonable nature: the piratebird.  </p> <p>Next, Pers asked the seagulls for help. But all they did was squawk and croak. Pers was thus none the wiser, and the seagulls wound up having a big argument. In fact, some of them became so angry that they refused to fly ever again, becoming auks... Though that's a different story. And so Pers asked a petrel for help. But the petrel would only teach him some impractical tricks, and not the basics that he needed most. Because, that noble seabird thought, surely it was better to learn how to soar through a stormy sky than to worry about trivial matters like taking off and landing.  </p> <p>Pers was now a very disappointed penguin. He waddled back to the beach and gazed out across the peaceful nighttime ocean. And as he did so, he noticed for the first time ever that the stars of his celestial homeland were reflected in the ocean. And he found them so beautiful that he simply... jumped in. And, after a brief moment of panicked sinking, Pers the Penguin realized that he could fly \u2014 underwater, at least. He could whizz speedily along, or twist and turn. It was, after all, what those strong wings and that smooth round body had been made for! And that is how Pers the Penguin became the first penguin to learn to swim. And after Pers, many other penguins plucked up the courage to take that leap into the waters and, like their ancestors, soar amongst the glimmering stars, exploring, feeding, and playing. Once Pers had shown them the way, the penguins took to life in the water and forgot their spacefaring past. Not even in their dreams did they remember that limitless void. The penguins live here now, between sea and land.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Tales_of_a_Snow-Winged_Goose/#vol-2-princess-marcotte","title":"Vol. 2 - Princess Marcotte","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A short fairy tale that is quite popular in Fontaine. Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend.</p> <p>In the not-too-distant past, every type of plant and every type of beast had its own kingdom. And in the Marcotte Kingdom, there live a princess with long pink hair. Legend has it that she was born in a crab claw and never put down roots \u2014 she always was, and always would be, a tough little seed. \"My darling daughter, my beloved treasure. Why not settle down and enjoy a life of nobility? Why do you wait so long to sprout and grow?\" asked her worried and kingly father. \"Father, father, please do not fret or rage. I was born in a crab claw, and that claw will be my ship. Your daughter's fate is not to take root in the mundane earth and grow pretty flowers. It is to conquer the seas and explore a new and wonderful world!\" The king was shocked by his daughter's plans. What was wrong with pretty flowers, he thought? Wasn't he a pretty flower? And what if his daughter one day decided to set down those roots and grow an even prettier garland than his? That would be terrible. But he only felt this way because he was ashamed of not being as pretty as he wanted to be.  </p> <p>And so, he had the princess and the crab claw locked up in a golden box. Then he hid the golden box in a mirror made of purest water. And then he threw the mirror into the sapphire lake of the Pluie Lotus Kingdom. There was only one way to reverse all those layers of confinement and free the princess (and the crab claw) \u2014 to make the Mother Lotus laugh. And as everyone knows, Pluie Lotuses are all too used to weeping.  </p> <p>\"All is well again,\" said the king. \"I can rest my regal head in peace. All I need to do is wait and wait, for my beloved daughter's seed to start to crack. She will lose her wanderlust. For what choice will she have, but to grow...\"  </p> <p>\"And then my daughter will be like me. She will follow her destiny and grow strong and healthy.\"  </p> <p>But the brave princess was not cowed by her long imprisonment. She wrote joke after joke to try and make the Mother Lotus laugh, and practiced telling those jokes over and over. The crab claw chortled. Even the golden box guffawed. But the Mother Lotus? Nothing. So she decided to write a comic play. She rehearsed until the crab claw couldn't help but burst into laughter and hop around \u2014 despite having no feet! She even converted the interior of the box into a theater. But still, nothing. Next, the princess tried to find comedy in the circumstances of her imprisonment \u2014 situational comedy, she called it. Soon the crab claw was, like the princess, laughing until it cried and then crying until it laughed. And eventually, the Pluie Lotus \u2014 keen criers, as we know \u2014 found themselves giggling. Finally, the Mother Lotus could contain her curiosity no longer, and the princess was granted an audience. And, to everyone's surprise, the princess didn't even need to tell a single joke. The Mother Lotus burst out laughing as soon as the princess entered the room. Her laughter grew louder and louder, shaking the palace walls and sending ripples across the sapphire lake. Princess Marcotte won her freedom. But she won something more valuable as well \u2014 the ability to laugh, and to make others laugh, even in the saddest of circumstances. In her crab claw ship, the princess sailed the ocean waves on her voyage to the new world of her dreams.

Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend.</p> <p>A long, long time ago, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman were good friends. Mr. Fox was a successful thief. The Clockwork Guardsman was... well, he was a guard. Clue's in the name, isn't it? But that was a long, long time ago, of course. They're still good friends, though. That will never change, no matter their jobs or social status. The Clockwork Guardsman had always had a worry curled up inside him, and as the years passed and his mechanisms aged, that worry got bigger and bigger, like a balloon, and heavier and heavier, like a piglet, and it was always there no matter how much he tried to shake it off, like Mr. Fox's lovely tail. It was a very worrying worry.  </p> <p>So the Clockwork Guardsman told his good friend, Mr. Fox, of this concerning concern: \"I've already lived a very long time. I've met so many people and said goodbye to so many. I've heard the funniest jokes and lived through the saddest times, and then I've forgotten it all and lived through it again. Even though forgetting isn't easy for a machine such as myself, it all fades.\" Mr. Fox understood his friend's concerns and knew just what to suggest: \"If living such a long life makes you forgetful and jaded, perhaps it is time to die, and in doing so, to make your life real.\" \"But, my fluffiest of friends,\" the Clockwork Guard said, removing his alloy guard's cap and sighing, \"didn't you steal Death from Ms. Toad's dressing table in that heist many years ago? It caused quite the commotion, as I recall. The living things of the world all forgot how to die.\" As, we all know, Ms. Toad is Death's envoy, the queen of all that is ugly, cold, and annoying. She guards that coldest jewel, Death itself.  </p> <p>\"Ah, I was so young then. I remember I was madly in love with Ms. Jackal, and I wanted to bring her the most expensive treasure I could find.\" \"And?\" \"I succeeded. But she died.\" Death slipped from Ms. Jackal's hand and shattered on the ground. The fragments melted into the earth, never to be seen again. And as that happened, the creatures of the world started to die as normal once more, with all that should have been dead now being so. Except, that is, for Mr. Fox, who should have died, but didn't. His life dragged on.  </p> <p>\"Death still exists in this world! All we need do is search for it!\" And so Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman, furry paw in cold metal hand, left the city they called home to search for Death in all the corners of the world. And they searched and they searched and then they searched some more. They searched until Mr. Fox's beautiful red coat had turned white. They searched until the Clockwork Guardsman's pride and joy, his official guard badge, had rusted. Finally, they reached the place where Ms. Toad lived.  </p> <p>\"Ms. Toad? Ms. Toad?\" called the Guardsman, as he knocked on the door. Ms. Toad opened the door slowly and stretched out her warty, scabby hand. \"Lovely Ms. Toad, I am so sorry to bother you again,\" said Mr. Fox as he took off his hat. \"But my good friend is in great pain, and you are the keeper of the only cure.\" \"Ms. Toad is of course aware of how lovely she is,\" came a rasping voice from within the ramshackle hut. \"And if your friend seeks Death, he will not find it here.\" \"Life is not tea and Death is not sugar. Their tastes cannot be distinguished if you live forever. But you have a mechanical heart and a mechanical tongue, and have tasted their flavor over and over, during each cycle of activation and deactivation...\" Ms. Toad removed an embroidered shroud to reveal the cold jewel called Death, then extended a hand, beckoning to the Clockwork Guardsman. \"Come, young guard, come, child. All must be tested, but do not admit defeat easily, my strong child...\" \"My maggots will not eat you, my moss will not grow on you. Whether your enemy is time or guilt, sadness or ennui... Do not admit defeat easily, my child.\" And with that, Ms. Toad took the guard's metal hand and placed it lightly on the jewel called Death, and he saw how long, long in the future, he would end\u2014 After countless years of hardships, a battered and beaten Clockwork Guardsman was thrown into the fires of the scrapping plant, to melt into a metallic ocean of millennia of waste. All those slow metal thoughts and hard metal ideas became swift and liquid. They evolved and combined and formed a new life. It was a glorious return for all metal lifeforms, making even the release of death fade in comparison.  </p> <p>And so the Clockwork Guardsman saw the future and gave up his dreams of dying. His good friend Mr. Fox, meanwhile, withdrew his thieving hand and left the jewel where it was. Indeed, life encompasses more than just bitterness akin to tea. If he had a friend to accompany him through the hard times, what rush was there? He could steal this extraordinary jewel later.  </p> <p>Later, as all children know, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman lived long, long lives, until the little world they lived in was but a desert, until the sun went out, until the moon fell... And even then, their story didn't end.

Legend has it that in the first era, the earliest peoples were self-supporting in their virtue, needing no laws or authorities. The envoys of the heavenly city walked the earth, and with their guidance, the people enjoyed enduring peace, prosperity, and abundance from the ancient days. This Heaven-blessed reign lasted countless generations until people grew tired of their inscrutable eternity. Their offspring ceased to listen to the oracles. Instead, they desired things never promised to them by the divine, trying to break free from their fate. Enraged by their behavior, Heaven sent gigantic waves to smash the settlers' cities. A hundred days of rain came afterward, and the roaring tides drowned all sin and arrogation, and thus were the early peoples brought to an end. When the tide receded and the earth was revealed again, no cities nor civilizations now stood above the high waters. Survivors and the newborn alike lived amidst the forests and rivers, shorn of all knowledge and wisdom. Human lives were no different from those of wild animals on the earth or in the sea, driven on by the laws of nature \u2014 muddling through time with neither beginning nor end. Untold years passed. The throne of Gurabad was established and overturned in the far south, and the noble kindred of the east once reached the rim of the high waters \u2014 all while our ancestors remained bound by ignorance and superstition. Civilization and order were finally restored to the land named Fontaine the day the great king Remus descended upon Meropis in his golden Fortuna. He taught people how to farm and raise crops in the land, and built temples and cities with giant rocks to house the people. Most importantly, it was he who spread the beauty of music and art, which differentiated humans from other living things, causing them to see themselves as masters of all things. With his immortal fleet, Remus conquered all the islands on the high waters. Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power. Those were the best days since the end of earliest peoples, and eternal prosperity seemed so near at hand. The God King and his people indulged in the sweet dreams of carefree lives and fantasies of never-ending progress. However, the seers prophesied discord: \"The greatest empire will face the most utter destruction, and this is Fortuna.\" Thus did the God King derive the primordial plan from the seven-day rotation and the flowing winds of sea and land, and composed a harmonious symphony of prosperity. He believed that so long as all the cities echoed with this greatest of songs, they would escape the judgment of fate and at last reach the land of eternal bliss. But thusly do the ancient writers concur \u2014 \"Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.\"  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_Remuria/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>It is said that the great scholar Pulteney wrote this epic historical work concerning the ancient Remurian civilization in the early years of the founding of Fontaine.</p> <p>Greatness and glory unto Remuria, and its immortal ruler, Remus, king of all under heaven and universal Harmost. Today, the glamor and luxury of the bygone Eternal City is beyond the imagination of even the most knowledgeable scholars. As you sailed past the Ocean Pillars along the royal fairway to the giant port playing host to Fortuna the imperial ship, you would have first seen a lofty tower. The tower of Remuria was not built to receive heavenly oracles, but to guide ships traveling between islands in the high waters. It is said that the tower stood at the border of reality and dreams. Even if sailors were to be lured into slumber by sirens, they could follow the sound of the bell to break through the mist and find their way to Remuria. Continuing along the royal fairway leading to Machimos, where the brave Remurian warriors lived. The grand temples and arenas were built with giant carved rocks to commemorate the city's glory and victory. The solid and towering walls are decorated with glaze and gold, bronze and marble statues arrayed the land, and gold, spices and specialties from the world over piled up in the markets. Traveling through Machimos, you would arrive at Capitolium, the center of Remuria, overflowing with delightful aromas and beautiful melodies. It was a paradise for artists, where only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians were allowed. Even among them, however, only a small fraction enjoyed the privilege of serving the God King. Here, all the theaters and palaces were established in shapes most harmonious, their beams and domes adorned with the most sumptuous and intricate carvings, and centered on a golden palace of towering copper pillars. The King, resting peacefully at the heart of the palace, listened closely to every melody and every note coming from every corner of the empire. Upon hearing any discord, the God King would correct it immediately with a pluck of his strings, bringing perfection to the symphony of his empire. To keep all the people upon the high water from destroying the symphony of universal harmony, King Remus promoted four humans of great capability to high post. He shared his power and authority with them, making them his partners in governance, the Harmosts for all cities, to eliminate all discordant sounds. To spread the harmonious symphony throughout the world, he built far-reaching fairways, which conveyed the melodies as never-ending ripples from Capitolium to every corner that sat above the high waters. Yet fate's decree was not for even such as gods to defy, and to even attempt to escape destined judgment was a mortal sin. Amongst the God King's sins, the most terrible was the attempt to pass power that should have been reserved for the godly domain to humans. Thus, this power and status led to corruption and decadence, leading to violence and revolts. Such is fate's cunning that it uses the very powers that rebel against it to its own ends. When the day of destiny arrived, Remuria, the grand immortal city, faced an inevitable end. Today, the God King's melody is played only in Capitolium, and his mighty reign has ended.

Until that day, when the earth collapsed all at once, the tall tower was uprooted, and drowned in the titanic waves alongside the great hall of pillars. Until that day, when the royal fairways and temples were reduced to ruins, and the city, along with its residents, warriors, intellectuals, nobles, and even the golden palace, as glamorous as the shining sun, fell into a chasm of eternal darkness. That was the moment when the absurdity of their \"eternity\" finally dawned on them. Glory to our Noble Navigator, the Ruler of Rivers and Seas, and the Queen of All Waters. May she defend the law, and may her reign be long. Peace be upon all the realms of Fontaine, and all the people under the heavens. When the royal city collapsed, the great power shattered, and the people above the high water were perched on the precipice of barbarism and annihilation, it was our noble Queen who settled the conflicts between the tribes. Around the flowing springs we established cities new, and started a world guided by laws that has endured to this day. The tragedy of Remuria occurred merely a century ago, but its history has already become concealed in legends and superstitions. This does partly come down to the fatal catastrophe that destroyed it \u2014 so ruthless and swift was the disaster that all the researchers and literature capable of passing down said knowledge now sleep beneath the waters with the Eternal City. Another key reason is the purposeful distortions created by the mysterious researchers who claimed to be descendants of Remuria. My job is to extract and reproduce the true, essential shape of this magnificent ancient civilization with the universal rationality of history. In certain folklore that exists today, even the greatest of ancient scholars have been painted as soul-stealing magisters who entrapped mortal spirits within specially-made magical golems, binding them into service. To be sure, the Remurians did make such terrifying golems, which to this day may be found, ruined, out in the wild. But this may only be blamed upon the moral degeneration that came upon them in Remuria's latter days. Its people had forsaken their noble duties and embraced hedonism and debauchery, accepting the violence they inflicted on others \u2014 and thus were they also violently destroyed.

He knew that this was the last time they would see each other. The old man asked, \"Do you need anything else?\" \"No.\" said the brother. The old man noticed that the sister frowned. He couldn't see it, but he felt it. \"What is it, Iris?\" the old man asked. He always liked Iris better. While she was considerate and passionate, she never hesitated when she had a gun in her hand.

Why had she asked for more, thinking that he would elope with her? Splat, splat, splat... \"She asked for too much...\" the Baron said, opening his eyes. \"Mother never asked for anything. She just wanted to live a quiet life like everyone else,\" Iris argued. Blood dripped from the grip of her musket, but her hand did not tremble. \"She asked me to give up my wealth and run away with her!\" the Baron roared. He was sure that his children didn't understand the idea of wealth and power. \"She asked you to give up your vanity, and give her true love instead, just as you had promised to,\" said Iris. \"You would have made the same choice were you in my shoes!\" \"No,\" said Tulipe with conviction, \"we would not kill our loved ones for wealth and power.

The storm battered the city, but nothing was louder than their silence. After a long time, Iris took out a Rainbow Rose and placed it on the Baron's chest. Then, falling into her brother's arms, she wept. The rain washed away her tears, and the mixture flowed freely into the earth, toward the realm of the dead...

If it weren't for the candles in the tavern, one would think that it was the heavy darkness of the night that had forced the door open. The intruder turned slightly.

The owner poured him a glass reluctantly, then looked at the door and wondered how long it would take him to wipe the boot-print off. \"Thank you,\" said the man, \"I just accomplished something great alongside my sister.\" \"Well, where is she?\" The owner asked, deciding to make some small talk. \"She went to plant flowers. I gave her all my money because she's always wanted to do that.\" \"How will you pay for your drink, then?\" The man seemed taken by surprise, as if he had never considered it. \"Guess I'll pay with this.\" The man tossed a black musket onto the bartop with a thud. The patrons next to him spilled their drinks in terror. Everyone held their breath. \"I'm not taking that.\" The owner feigned calm as he replied, but quietly, he reached into the drawer under the bar, where he hid a pistolet. He wasn't sure if he could fire faster than the man in front of him, though. \"Don't worry, it just fired its last and most important shot, and it will never be used again.\" The explanation done, the man downed another drink. The owner caught a glimpse of the man's face when he raised his head. It was a handsome face, with a high nose, some scars, and sad black eyes. The owner withdrew his hand from the drawer. This man wasn't here to cause a scene. It was almost as if he had been drunk even before entering the tavern. \"May I have another?\" the man asked. \"You've had enough,\" replied the owner. \"I know, but tonight was special.\" He didn't notice that the owner was trying to get him to leave. \"How so?\" \"I just killed someone.\" The owner's hands froze. Coming from this man, it didn't sound like a joke. \"It was revenge,\" added the man. \"He killed my mother.\" \"And who was 'he'?\" \"The Baron.\" \"Nonsense.\" Now the owner was certain that the man was drunk. Everyone knew that the Baron was bad news. Many wanted to kill him, but none dared to risk their lives to try. \"I suppose you could have missed the gunshot if your farts were loud enough,\" the man taunted. The owner looked at the man again. He had large hands and a muscular build. He seemed to have been through countless fights \u2014 no tavern scuffles these, but real fights that had put his life on the line. Something flashed across the owner's mind. He recalled the recent series of musket murders, where the killer always left a Rainbow Rose and struck on stormy nights... \"No way... Are you...\" Before the owner could finish, lightning struck beyond the wooden door, and a wild gale threw it open. Night flooded in, drowning the patrons like a tidal wave. When the candles were lit again, the man was gone, but he had left his musket behind. It stared everyone down in silence like some solemn god of death, staring into the night that belonged to it...  </p> <p>\u2014The Two Musketeers, Fin.</p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Time_Trekker/","title":"Time Trekker","text":""},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Time_Trekker/#vol-1","title":"Vol. 1","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A Fontainian science fiction novel published by The Steambird.

After the evening banquet, Ms. Aviva (who today would be Lady Nenonen) was, as always, theatrically grousing to us about the all-too-swift march of science. Though her grasp on engineering is even less firm than her knowledge of Watatsumi Island's soil quality (and of course, she knows nothing about the latter either), but self-proclaimed interest in engineering was in vogue amongst some ladies and gentlemen at the time.  </p> <p>\"Our ancestors had already conquered this land thousands of years ago,\" she said as she cleared her throat, twirling her jade-plumed and blue-gem-encrusted folding fan while endeavoring in vain to wear a visage of despondency. \"And a few hundred years ago, they conquered the oceans with ease using new diving equipment.

They have conquered most of the natural world, and by their will, they can shape this world anew.\"  </p> <p>\"Ah, that's... not what I meant to say,\" Ms. Aviva said with an affected sigh. \"Those distant and dark unknown continents, those ruins hidden deep beneath the seas, all that romantic exploration and trailblazing \u2014 such great achievements, that which has put the glorious achievements of our sciences and reasoning on full display \u2014 have all but become lost to our civilization.

This was, evidently, a more popular topic, and the stiff atmosphere once again grew lively. Monsieur Ratar was just about to regale us with a tale he had heard in Sumeru regarding a tower, a mage, and a glass ball, but before he could begin, Mr. Ciric, who had remained silent till now, interrupted.  </p> <p>\"Good Ms. Aviva, the things you said certainly left an impression on me.\" He lit a cigarette. \"However, you need not worry.

As such, it is a part of nature, and can thus be conquered.\"  </p> <p>\"Utterly preposterous...\" The doctor muttered, but did not refute the statement.  </p> <p>\"I have been involved in research of this sort for some time,\" he continued, \"and I have come up with a machine that can allow people to travel through time as they please.

Ms. Aviva was not there, for she never had much interest in such things, but instead found more meaning in attending a social ball at Salon Caritat.  </p> <p>Surprisingly, Ciric had grown older and more frail in just two months. In the dim light of the lamp, his once enthusiastic, arrogant expression had hardened into something indifferent and solemn, almost like the emaciated ascetics of Sumeru.  </p> <p>He welcomed us to take our seats, speaking in a calm tone.  </p> <p>\"Well then, how is your plan to conquer time progressing?\" The Steambird editor asked directly. \"Where is the time machine you spoke of?\"  </p> <p>Ciric did not reply. Instead, he pointed to the desk next to him. Our gazes followed, and in the middle of that table was a gold-plated whale-shaped model airship about the size of a small clock.

We agreed, and so he began to tell the story I shall now relate below, without interruption from beginning to end.  </p> <p>For all of you, it was two months ago when I first told you of the idea of a time machine. Similarly, it must have been a week ago when I finished constructing said device and stepped into it, initiating the very first instance of time travel in human history.  </p> <p>The strange sensations that came over me as I traveled through time are beyond words, just as there are no words with which one can impress the stars' brightness upon a blind person. About twenty minutes after this \u2014 though describing time travel by using subjective time is quite meaningless \u2014 the machine ceased operation. I looked about me then, and realized that I was in a Remurian imperial settlement. The grand temples and arenas carved of titanic stone would make the Opera Epiclese hang its head in shame, while the creations of Alain Guillotin would be little more than a child's wind-up toy before the towering Remurian golems. Just as I was beside myself in awe, a few patrolling troops discovered me. Seeing my strange style of dress, they took me to be a spy for the barbarian tribes. They seized me, naming me a lowly slave, a degenerate believer in a false god, and threatened to throw me into a deep cistern to feed the vipers.  </p> <p>Fortunately, the local Aedile \u2014 I later found out that her name was Aidia Anavana \u2014 realized that my identity was anything but ordinary, and had me sent before her. She endured my calamitous grammar and catastrophic accent (at that time, I could not even pronounce \"Remuria,\" with it coming out something more akin to \"Emuia\") while asking me many questions, which I answered truthfully. Quickly, she accepted the fact that I was from the future and showed me a stone slate that the slaves had recently dug up.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Fontaine/Time_Trekker/#vol-3","title":"Vol. 3","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A Fontainian science fiction novel published by The Steambird. It tells the story of an engineer's travels using a time machine.  </p> <p>The slate was a perfect square, each line and column engraved with seven symmetrical sequences of symbols \u2014 these were not in Remurian script, but rather the characters we use today. Regardless of the manner in which the text was read, or the order, or direction, the information within the text did not change \u2014 it was an elaborate riddle involving dogs, pastures, cyan finches, the summer rains, the song of the roses, a Rishboland Tiger's stripes, and the ordered patterns of rocks. Despite my long-time love of wordplay games, this endless cycle of riddles made me terribly dizzy. For some reason, I knew that I must solve it, no matter the price. I spent half a year doing so alongside Aidia \u2014 and as it turned out, the key to deciphering it lay with the name of a slave now thirty years dead, while the answer was a date, set several hundred years after the empire's fall.  </p> <p>I bade Aidia farewell and stepped back upon the time machine, forwarding myself to that date in hopes of finding the secret behind that stone slate. There, I met several Marechaussee Hunters, and they showed me another stone slate, which again had 49 mirrored characters on it that formed another riddle. Again, the answer was a date, one set in a future still further off.  </p> <p>Following these stone slates' directions, I cris-crossed the fabric of past and future, shuttling back and forth 13 times. Each stone slate's riddle was trickier than the last. One of them could only be cracked using a bad romance novel that would only be published 300 years hence \u2014 the 5th word of the 37th page of that book would form a conjugate with the full name of the 375th Maison Gardiennage officer from 375 years ago. Another riddle's cipher was based on a white flower that will only bloom several millennia in the future \u2014 I know not its name, and its pistil structure is very strange indeed. It might be a mallow of some sort, but I cannot be sure. That flower is nourished by skylark calls, and so one of the clues to its cipher was the number of ribs on a skylark during Remurian times. I suppose that is, generally speaking, just how the riddles worked.  </p> <p>The final stone slate came from the underground storeroom of the Basil Elton Memorial Museum, and had naught but one number on it: \"0.\"  </p> <p>I do not know what I was thinking at the moment. After all, setting my destination to \"0\" is an action utterly devoid of meaning. But I punched the number into my machine all the same and pulled the control lever. After who knows how long, the machine stopped. I sensed that I was floating atop a sea with no waves or tides, for even the wind did not exist at that moment. The sky that loomed overhead was not blue, but a dark red adorned with countless stars, pale and distant, like salt frost lining the shore.  </p> <p>I stared at this very first of oceans, transfixed, and several minutes passed before I realized that there was something shadowy hidden beneath the placid surface. It was the Palais Mermonia, which should not be there.  </p> <p>At that moment, I could hear someone call me by name \u2014 Neven Ciric, the voice called. I turned, and it was like looking into a mirror. A man, identical to myself, looking me dead in the eye, just as I did to him.  </p> <p>\"Neven Ciric,\" he continued, \"you wish to conquer time. No one can do that.\"  </p> <p>\"It was you who left those riddles behind?\"  </p> <p>\"It was you who left those riddles behind.\" He repeated my question as if it was an answer. \"Those riddles are part of time, and every matching symbol is time itself.\"  </p> <p>\"So, the final answer to the riddle of time is zero.\"  </p> <p>\"Zero is not an answer. Instead, it is another mystery, for the answer cannot be found in the riddle,\" he said. \"The answer to time's riddle is a mirror \u2014 or perhaps I should say that this is the answer that is simplest to comprehend. When two mirrors face each other, time is the infinite reflection of light therein. Countless diverging, converging, and parallel lights form the illusion we call time. There is no past or future, for the past is the future. As you stand here at Moment Zero and look forward along the gap between the two mirrors, all beams of light fall along the same plane, and not one may escape. The Palais Mermonia had already sunk long before it was ever built, and the sunken Palais will be raised anew. Joy, sorrow, tears, and death must infinitely recur, for this is the nature of a mirror. Similarly, you can never conquer time, just as you can never grasp your shadow in your hand.\"  </p> <p>Perhaps it was horror or momentary frenzy, but when he finished, I whipped out the firearm I kept for self-defense, leveled it at his head, and pulled the trigger.  </p> <p>The room was silent.  </p> <p>\"I do not expect you to believe me,\" Ciric said as he stood up, his eyes sweeping the room. \"Just take it as a bunch of bunk that I made up to cover up for my inability to make a time machine. Make of it some lame tale, a dream born purely of delusion. In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I shall take my leave of you \u2014 my future self awaits a riddle that I must set him.\"  </p> <p>I never saw Ciric Neven again.</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/A_Legend_of_Sword/","title":"A Legend of Sword","text":"<p>Author: Zhenyu (pen name of Xingqiu) Illustrator: Calx (pen name of Albedo)</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/A_Legend_of_Sword/#vol-1","title":"Vol. 1","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Amid a sea of stars that spin in reverse, light-centuries of war unfold down on the planet's surface...

It is said that during this time, the Great Serpent Orobashi broke the coral branches off his body and guided the people of the deep sea back to the light of day, and by his grace and pity, he gathered them together to make a living upon the barren island of coral.

The bright sun, the clear skies, and seas, the clam palace that glittered with rainbow light, the teachings of the clergy... None of these could assuage the wounds of hunger and disease. The Great Serpent never forgot his past as one of the defeated, or his oath to never again allow his people to be forsaken. So he asked the shrine maiden: \"Blessed daughter of mine, why do the people of the deep sea weep? Have I not defeated the Dragonheirs of the Depths and given you the light of day?\" The wise shrine maiden replied: \"Famine.\" The Great Serpent asked again: \"Indeed, it is my failing that has caused you to go hungry. What then, my people, is your request?\" The honest elders replied: \"You made a road for us, guiding us to create a nation amidst the blue seas with no need for robbery, oppression, or tyranny. For this, we are already more than grateful... Yet, to the east of our coral island, there are lands wider and more fertile still.\" \"Permit us, great lord, to set foot upon those islands and there carve out a dominion for ourselves, that our children after us shall have a glorious past, a future in fullness, and a present without darkness.\"  </p> <p>The Great Serpent was silent and made no reply. Narukami it was that dominated the eastern islands, possessing great strength in war, and those deities defeated thus were all slain to the last, in accordance with the law of the divine realm. But in the many years that followed, the hungry and diseased people would ask time and again, at last moving the heart of their god. Thus did the Great Serpent train them to become mighty warriors who commandeered ships and sea monsters while mastering wave and cloud, leading them in an invasion of the Electro Archon's lands amidst the whistling of whalesongs... But the people of the sea knew not that Watatsumi Omikami had embarked upon a violent campaign in which he had no hope of victory, and his purpose was not conquest, but sacrifice. It is said that there were inscriptions which the shrine maiden hid, upon which were written a prophecy of the certain defeat and the future of humiliation that awaited this eastern expedition.  </p> <p>Orobashi's true motives are not well-recorded by history. This is merely a hypothesis drawn by those who discovered the inscriptions in latter days: Watatsumi Omikami long knew that he would not have any chance of survival this time, but accepted the prophecy's result calmly. If he wished to ensure the perpetuation of his people's \"faith,\" there was but one path \u2014 sacrifice. Even if Watatsumi would pass away, its people would endlessly weave their memories of joy, prosperity, bitterness, and loss into a united faith. These memories, in turn, would flourish on account of the intense emotions of a vanquished people forced into shameful submission.  </p> <p>Many among the Watatsumi people now no longer believe that their guiding Omikami has any chance of revival, but their pride as Watatsumi's people, the pain of watching the body of their god carved up for minerals by their overlord, the hurt of losing that god... These emotions have passed on from generation to generation, becoming the pillars of forbearance, resistance, and sacrifice that underpin the faith of Watatsumi's people.  </p> <p>As the author has mentioned, Sangonomiya has an extreme lack of written historical material. As such, these past motives have all essentially become fictional tales upon which future generations can inscribe any meaning they wish. Thus, these histories have become \"histories of accumulated consciousness\" rather than \"histories of recorded fact.\" The fact that this collective consciousness has been strengthened and rendered ever more cohesive over time, such that a people who have lost their beloved god may still actively resist a nation whose faith is in a mighty elemental deity... This just goes to show that their persistence is hardly some obsolete thing.  </p> <p>Notably, this tendency to give little thought to the \"facts\" of the past and emphasize the \"consciousness\" of the present is a glaring flaw in Watatsumi today. The flames of these hatreds and humiliations, borne and nursed over hundreds and thousands of years, can be fanned by those with an agenda in leaner years and ultimately bring catastrophe upon the nation.  </p> <p>But though I say this, while the people of Watatsumi are known for their forbearance, are they really to grin and bear this mortification endlessly for the sake of survival? With their recent economic exploitation at the hands of the Kanjou Commission, more and more of the young people of Watatsumi Island are discussing resistance and their complaints. It seems evident to me that these discussions are not merely about the past, but about the present and future also.  </p> <p>However, there is another version of the legend of Watatsumi Omikami's slaying: While the people of the deep yet dwelt in the depths, they kept very reliable chronicles, for there was no day or night for them. If they kept no precise records, they would even forget what time it was. But these chronicles were ordered sealed in Enkanomiya by the Great Serpent, never to be retrieved. The names of the people of Watatsumi were also not written in the Inazuman style then. The names and surnames used today by them came about by order of the Great Serpent, who had them learn the traditions of Narukami. It is said that when Watatsumi Omikami decided to bring the people of the depths out of the waters, he did this at the instruction of the heavens themselves. For Watatsumi Omikami had once fled into the Dark Sea to avoid the Archon War, committing a grave sin in the process. Thus perhaps it was upon heaven's order that Orobashi went to his death \u2014 though this cannot be known for sure. Unfortunately, the script once used in Enkanomiya is known to few, and the books themselves have been hidden there also. Thus, I fear that the truth of the matter shall never see the light of day. However, these legends that hint at the \"truth\" are but unimportant anecdotes compared to the aforementioned ones that imply much about the \"consciousness\" of the people.</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Debates_on_the_Viceroy_of_the_East/","title":"Debates on the \u201cViceroy of the East\u201d","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The \"Viceroy of the East,\" or \"Touzannou\" sung of in Watatsumi folk tradition is also known as the \"Akuou\" all across Raiden's domains.

This boy later apprenticed himself to Mouun and her sister, learning from them the whalesongs and rites of Watatsumi. His memories were colored by the palace of coral and clam, the shining schools of fish and the rainbow-hued mackerel, and his body was tempered by the rugged reefs and endless waves, becoming strong and swift.  </p> <p>The songs of the Yuna Clan say that when the boy had grown into a young man, he was invited by Mouun the shrine maiden to swim together amidst tides lit by moon and stars alike. In the ebb and flow of the entwined lights, the young man sensed the words and emotions of the sea creatures, and hearing the shrine maiden's gentle, mournful whispers, he decided his future course.  </p> <p>It is said that after this night-time excursion, the young man comprehended the sword styles known as \"Getsumouun\" and \"Yuushio.\" Though he would not have any descendants, these sword techniques would be taught amongst the warriors of Watatsumi and passed down from generation to generation, thus never becoming extinct. In Watatsumi Island, which lacks traditions of swordsmanship, these two styles remain effective and practical techniques that can prove perilous to any foe.  </p> <p>When Watatsumi Omikami set off on the eastern expedition from which there would be no return, the young man headed up the vanguard and took a place known then to the Watatsumi people as Touzan. Thus was he given the honorific of Touzannou by Watatsumi Omikami himself.

I hope this book \u2014 in spite of its small volume \u2014 can bring you some simple joy after a long day of work.</p> <p>\"All Dodocos must someday ride the wind and the waves and go on an adventure.\" A gentle and beautiful mother once said that. And just as she had predicted, our Dodoco was so happy when its best friend, Klee, said that she was going to the nation of lightning for an adventure! Of course, Dodoco loves eating delicious food with Klee at Good Hunter, and loves listening to the bards sing. But Dodoco loves counting the stars in the sky and twisting flowers into garlands together with Klee more. After all, all Dodocos long to ride the wind and waves on an adventure.  </p> <p>To get to Inazuma, one needs to pass through the wild winds and pass over the great waves. But Dodoco did not fear the howling wind, for that was the blessing of the Anemo Archon. Dodoco did not worry about the rolling waves either, for it was very brave. Of course, Dodoco didn't want Klee to have to brave such dangers. But as bestest friends, they were bound to protect each other. And Dodoco didn't want to be apart from Klee anyway. Without Klee, adventures would be like Sweet Flowers that cannot bloom, lonely and sad things. Even if Dodoco were to cover every inch of Teyvat by land or sea, it would be meaningless. So there was no point hesitating. Dodoco and its best friend Klee were off on an adventure! If they rode on a boat, they wouldn't be able to fly freely in the sky, or swim happily in the sea... But they'd have Klee's smile and Albedo's stories. And that was a good trade!  </p> <p></p> <p>In Inazuma, the nation of lightning, the flowers and grasses are all purple, and the fish and the birds are also purple. Everything is purple! Albedo would probably run out of purple paint trying to paint it all. Unfortunately, he couldn't be around to draw with Klee and Dodoco. Albedo was an adult, after all. And sometimes adults have to do adult-things. Fortunately, Dodoco still had Klee! Klee would often find happy things to do. As long as Dodoco was with Klee, Dodoco would never be bored.  </p> <p>Klee also had lots of friends in Inazuma, like Mr. Honorary Knight, Paimon, and Yoimiya. And so they all joined Dodoco for the most fun adventure ever in Inazuma! Hooray for adventure!  </p> <p>Mr. Honorary Knight took Dodoco up the tall, tall Mt. Yougou. When they got to the Sacred Sakura, they were so tired from all that climbing that they fell asleep. And when they woke up, everyone had grown wings like a tengu! Klee's wings were red, Yoimiya's were gold, and Mr. Honorary Knight's were blue. As for Paimon... Paimon can fly without wings, so Paimon didn't grow any. Everyone opened their wings up, causing a huge gust of wind to roll forth. Shooom~ And the shrine maiden's hair was all messed up. Oh no, she looked angry! Better run, quick!  </p> <p>Ah, adventure truly was fun... But with a growl, Klee's stomach started calling out. Oh no! How could they have forgotten? Eating is an important part of adventuring too! Om nom nom nom~ And so everyone ate the onigiri they brought along, and they all had a great time. Dodoco and Paimon finished their share very quickly, and as the very, very full Dodoco looked at Klee's smile, it couldn't help but think\u2014 Meeting Klee and the others is the most hap-happiest thing that ever happened to Dodoco!  </p> <p> </p> <p>Oh, yes.

He promptly chopped four pounds of melon and placed it onto the scale.  </p> <p>\"Hey, how come your scale's all wonky?\"  </p> <p>Dozaemon grasped his blade the moment Itaru said this.  </p> <p>\"Well, isn't that something \u2014 this scale's got a mind of its own!\"  </p> <p>\"Glad you're so amused. But it's time to pay up now.\"  </p> <p>Dozaemon could no longer hold back his anger. The time for pleasantries was over \u2014 it was time to talk sense.  </p> <p>\"Heh, I don't have a problem with paying you what you're due... I'm just not sure you'd be able to take it.\"  </p> <p>\"Oh, don't you worry \u2014 I'll take whatever you've got to give!\"  </p> <p>\"You sure about that!?\"  </p> <p>\"Try me!\"  </p> <p>Suddenly, Itaru yelled \"take this!\" and threw a bag full of Mora directly at Dozaemon's face. Dozaemon didn't react in time, and took the full force of the impact square on the nose. He fell backwards onto the ground as his precious wakizashi went flying from his hand and fell beside him. On closer inspection, his nose had been squashed completely flat by the bag of Mora: It looked just like the kind of pouch one might use to store a pipe, only without the pipe inside.  </p> <p>Itaru walked over and pressed her foot down on the dishonest merchant's chest. Without a word, she hit Dozaemon so hard it felt like a Liyue martial arts tournament was being hosted on his face. With great difficulty, he fought to get back on his feet, but just as he had stood up and grabbed his blade, Itaru noticed and landed another ferocious blow to his head. This time, it hit so hard that a pair of tanuki ears popped out in response. He began to beg for mercy.  </p> <p>Itaru burst out laughing at the sight in front of her. So, the merchant is a youkai in disguise \u2014 and a filthy tanuki at that!  </p> <p>Itaru promptly confiscated the tanuki's stolen wakizashi, distributed most of its ill-gotten wealth among the villagers, and handed the rest to the mother and daughter who had fallen victim to its scheme earlier. Itaru spared the tanuki's life \u2014 albeit not without some reluctance \u2014 and continued on her way.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/New_Chronicles_of_the_Six_Kitsune/#vol-5","title":"Vol. 5","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Commentary regarding ancient matters that was specially added to the \"New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.\" If you find it an insipid, monotonous slog, dear reader, you may skip this volume.

Please forgive me for nagging, but I have some old matters I wish to comment on. Now, it is no longer well-known how exactly Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu at that time. However, Lady Yae did offer to tell me some snippets of the history she experienced after having between two and eight drinks. This is a novel, of course, so I naturally would like to turn these words into a story of what history has not recorded. When the Kitsune Saiguu departed from the Hakushin Lands to take up her post at the Grand Narukami Shrine, Lady Yae still had yet to be born. As such, her early years were filled with stories and tales about Saiguu, and she loved and respected her greatly. This is also why Lady Yae would eventually come to the Grand Narukami Shrine herself after embarking on her own travels.  </p> <p>Due to their closeness by blood, Lady Saiguu doted upon Lady Yae quite a bit, though Lady Yae speaks as little as possible about those times as she may nowadays... \u2014And while I as a novelist write to entertain, I shall refrain from revealing too much about Lady Yae's past, lest I suffer under the editor-in-chief's mighty pen.  </p> <p>But back to Urakusai. It is no longer clear how Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu back in the day, but it is known that his deeds may have had some connection to the later incursion of the Abyss. However, after Urakusai had been driven out, the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer dwell at the Grand Narukami Shrine, but would instead set up permanent residence at Tenshukaku.  </p> <p>\"A disaster that will engulf heaven and earth is coming.

The dark clouds roared as they closed in, swallowing the village whole. The ink-like flames raged and spread, devouring hundreds of houses all the way to the seaside, causing the seawater to steam and churn, and turning the sand on the shallows into a molten slurry. The chieftain shoved Riko into an underground cellar. The last words she heard still rang in her ears, drowning out the cries of anguish all around. \"Kataba Shintetsu has betrayed the oni. It was she who brought about this disaster!\" Riko's swordsmanship was taught to her by Shintetsu personally. As far as she could remember, Shintetsu was a demure girl who always wore a faint smile as she talked to others. Until today, Riko still could not accept that her teacher, the sword prodigy respected by all, could have done something so cruel. But yet the symbols and talismans scattered around the village made a convincing counterpoint. The chieftain could not have been mistaken... How should she face Shintetsu? Riko had not yet decided, and could only sigh deeply. The noise startled a nearby white cat, and squinting its two mottled eyes, the cat rubbed the back of Riko's hand. \"Sorry, Onigiri. Did I wake you?\" Riko brought her wooden bowl out and placed it before the cat. Listening to the soft sounds of it lapping at the water, she looked up at the sky outside her tent. Through the gaps in the leaves could the cliffs and mountains under the moonlight be seen, its silver glow tracing the intricate outlines of buildings on the ridges, forming a unique spectacle. Arayama City lay before her. The towering mountains had all been hollowed out, with a majestic city being built within them. Legend had it that the \"people of the mountain\" here were the descendants of giants, standing at two times the height of an ordinary person. Even the plants and crops here were larger than anything elsewhere. Moreover, Arayama City's \"Arahara Army\" was said to be powerful indeed, having fought with the surrounding nations many times while suffering very few defeats. But Arayama City's brutal lord was not satisfied, and would not be till he had achieved absolute dominion. Three days ago, the lord had invited Kataba Shintetsu to join the Arahara Army and train his troops in the swordsmanship that the oni had prided themselves in. Shintetsu had agreed gladly... But regardless of Shintetsu's intentions, Riko's current goal was to find her, defeat her, and mete out the punishment she deserved. Then, she would follow the clues that the chieftain had given her to search for the true teachings of \"Shiseidou,\" and use the magatama within Onigiri's body to revive her tribespeople. Thinking thus, Riko put a little more wood on the fire before lying down her side and entering a shallow slumber, preserving her strength for the battle that would commence the next day. ...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Onibudou/#arayama-city-arc-chapter-15","title":"Arayama City Arc: Chapter 15","text":"<p>The standoff had been broken. The burly commander stood about a hundred paces off, observing the battle personally and executing several deserters. These deeds had the remarkable effect of calming the Arahara Army and steadying their formation. No one dared speak of the assassination of their lord now. \"What are you afraid of? That little brat doesn't even come up to a Lavender Melon's height. Get her!\" The troops looked at each other until forced by their commander's enraged roar to charge at Riko. Riko heard it, of course. The hand that wielded her sword trembled, and Onigiri, hidden within her hood, mewled softly in fear. Well, I'm sorry that we oni lived on a deserted island and didn't get an opportunity to grow tall, and thus aren't fit to be your opponents. But a \"fit\" has got nothing to do with my ability to defeat you. Spinning on one tipped toe, Riko let fly her blade with a transient flash of crimson red. Light arced across the battlefield, piercing through the commander's torso. \"Kissaki Yousen.\" This was the same special sword technique that the wandering spirit of the previous lord of the city had imparted to Riko \u2014 a fatal blade that utterly ignored all distances in battle. With a terrible, clean crack, the enemy commander's sword split in two, and he fell forward with an inaudible murmur, dead. Seeing their general go down, the Arahara Army stopped dead in its tracks. Not a single soldier dared to go a step further. Indeed, their formation fell into chaos swiftly thereafter, melting away utterly. Thus did Arayama City fall, and thus did the people who had long been oppressed rise up and take the lord's mansion, seizing back all that had once belonged to them. Yet through all this, Kataba Shintetsu did not show her face. Sheathing her sword, Riko realized that something was off, glancing upward towards the distant mountain peak. There stood Shintetsu upon Arayama City's greatest height, atop its blazing tower, watching the whole battle. Her face was shrouded in shadow, her expression unreadable. The two women locked gazes for an instant, and then with a leap, Shintetsu was gone. Kataba Shintetsu... Why had she come here? She had accepted the invitation of the lord of this city, only to turn around and assassinate him... Did she still have some good left in her? Riko shook her head. Now was not the time for excess thoughts. Comforting Onigiri, she quickly ran towards Arayama City. If she did not continue her pursuit in all haste, Shintetsu was sure to leave her far behind. ...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Onibudou/#ryuutetsu-cage-arc-chapter-1","title":"Ryuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 1","text":"<p>She had gotten careless. This encampment was nothing but a well-disguised trap. Kataba Shintetsu had intentionally exposed her tracks, placing a large number of talismans amidst the camp, luring Yutaka Riko to pursue her. The moment Riko stepped into the camp, the talismans blew the mountainside clean away, and losing her footing, Riko plummeted into the chasm below... The impact of the fall was not an issue, but Ryuutetsu Cage, which lay below in the depths of the mountain, was the greatest threat. This chasm was once a pass separating two nations, and it was the site of a monstrous battle in which nearly a million people were slain. After the war ended, the two nations both sealed this area, pouring their destroyed weapons into this mountain rift. The souls of the unjustly slain warriors were trapped within the bloodied, broken metal, and as the shattered metal churned and turned, it would slowly evolve into the flowing metal sands seen today. There was no clear distinction between solid ground and the metal dunes, and one could step out onto the sand and immediately sink into the mire, unable to escape as the churning metal sands had swallowed and ground one into dust. One wrong step, and there would be no going back. This strange iron sand even spread across the stone walls, making even the idea of escape by climbing out laughable in the extreme. Only by slowly traversing the path at the bottom of the chasm could one have any hope of escape. But it was clear that no one had ever managed it. Those who fell into this cage may as well have been sentenced to death. But Riko was like a woman unburdened. Here was undeniable proof that Kataba Shintetsu had long forsaken any mercy or goodness. Now, when she lifted her sword against her, Riko would not have to hesitate. Not only this, but Shintetsu had underestimated the progress that Riko had made. This prison of metal sand would not hold her, for she had previously mastered the powerful ability named \"Reppuu Tenshoku,\" which now came in handy. But just as Riko was about to use that technique, she spied two small heads peeping around the corner of a rock face. They were girls dressed in rags, their eyes gleaming with hope. \"Are you from the outside world?\" Riko nodded, retrieving Onigiri from her hood. It gave the two girls a limp greeting. The two girls took Riko to a mountain cave, and there she met their elders \u2014 a miserable group they were, having wound up in Ryuutetsu Cage by mistake. \"We've been stuck here for several months now. We've barely managed to get by on the grains on our cart, spring water, moss and wild vegetables...\" They were nine people and one cat. She had just enough strength to carry them all out on the woven wings of a gale. Thus, she made this offer: \"How would you like to escape together with me?\" The old man who led the party kept his eyes on Riko's pale red horn, hesitation in his eyes. \"Warrior... If my eyes do not deceive me, you must be of oni descent, right?\" Unease flashed across Riko's heart. \"That's right, I am an oni. Is there a problem?\" ...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Onibudou/#ryuutetsu-cage-arc-chapter-14","title":"Ryuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 14","text":"<p>Onigiri's tail, like a compass' needle, quivered for a moment before pointing forward and to the right. Yutaka Riko stepped forward tentatively \u2014 onto solid rock. Good! The chasm's exit was close at hand now. If she followed her present speed, she and Onigiri would escape Ryuutetsu Cage before dawn the next day. \"Well done, Onigiri.\" Riko had never known till this day that Onigiri's spirit-sight could not only find wandering spirits that could help Riko master all manner of abilities but that it could also be used to steer clear of danger. The vengeful spirits of the Ryuutetsu Cage were unveiled in Onigiri's eyes as if in plain sight, allowing it to find a safe way through. Perhaps this was the work of the magatama within Onigiri... Were her tribespeople watching over her? Even so close to freedom and escape, Riko could not be pleased. The words of those people buzzed in her ears, agitating and irritating her. \"Even if we starve here, I'll never trust an oni!\" What was with that? She was an oni, sure, but so what? Everyone was kind, and they had lived peacefully and kept to themselves on their island. Why were they seen as the enemy? Yet the gazes of those two children were too innocent, and Riko would not leave them to their fate. So she had left all her dry rations with them before using \"Kagamichuu Shubutsu\" to copy them several times, thus ensuring that they would have enough food to last another half a month. She had memorized the entire route that she had taken as well. Once they departed, she would look for a nearby garrison and mark the safe route out for them. This way, the garrison would be able to rescue the trapped people. Ah, this was so exhausting \u2014 worse than any battle she had experienced before. Riko's eyes were dull as she petted Onigiri idly. Sometimes, all we need is a scapegoat to pin our negativity on in order to bounce back. As a hazy figure materialized before Riko's eyes, she muttered, irrepressible resentment in her voice, \"This is all your fault, Kataba Shintetsu...\" \"Next time, I won't let you escape.\" ...</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Pretty_Please_Kitsune_Guuji/","title":"Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A popular light novel in Inazuma which tells the story of the \"good-for-nothing\" Shogun and the \"good-at-everything\" Kitsune Guuji.

Now, I gotta get back to cooking. I made your favorite Butter Crab today!\" \"Yay! Butter Crab, my favorite Butter Crab!\"  </p> <p>I, the Raiden Shogun, whose signature line is \"Yay!\" and whose favorite food is Butter Crab, spend most of my time with... Um, basically, there are only two kinds of people in my life: nobodies, and the one with fluffy ears and a teasing voice. Yae Masako, Guuji of the Grand Kaminaru Shrine, descendant of Kitsune lineage, and Eternity's servant and friend... She goes by too many names to remember. In the eyes of the people of Inazuma, she is almost as unapproachable and unfathomable as I.  </p> <p>Yet that very Yae Masako is intently watching the Butter Crab as it is being baked. Yes, simply put, I, the Raiden Shogun, am being looked after by Guuji Yae Masako.  </p> <p>Before I knew it, I had already got used to this way of life. Every time I just randomly swing my sword, she'll enthusiastically clap her hands and say: \"Good girl!\" Every time I look for some snacks to go with \"Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power,\" she can always produce delicious milk tea and cake in no time. She carefully extinguishes every flicker of potential annoyance as if she is maintaining Eternity. For me, she is like a kitsune from the legend who grants every wish of mine. \"Butter Crab is ready! Before enjoying the food, allow me to get back to our previous question about patrolling...\"  </p> <p>Masako turns around, setting the steaming-hot Butter Crab on the table, its scent soon permeating the room. But I can't bring myself to answer her question \u2014 to be honest, this is the reason why I am so down today. Like I said, there are only Masako and other people in my world. All of them, except Masako, would do the same thing upon seeing me: They would bow to the ground in the most respectful manner and address me as \"Almighty Shogun.\" When I walk away, they will then straighten up with a sigh of relief. It doesn't matter if they are someone's wife, father, boyfriend, or girlfriend, it doesn't matter if they are someone's boss, servant, or hero. They always put on the same face in front of me \u2014 one that exhibits the reverence and fear for the Almighty Shogun. Yet none know how I equally fear that very face of theirs. Who wouldn't? Just think about it: thousands of people putting on the same face in your presence.  </p> <p>That is why I rely so much on Masako. That is why I couldn't reject her request. Although I can't do it, I will always go out to work as long as she wants me to. To be honest, I don't know how to deal with those identical faces \u2014 thousands of them. I don't want to, and I can't. As long as I get to avoid making contact with them, I don't mind being called a loser Shogun. But still, although I don't mind that, I can't face Masako's questions. \"Why are you so quiet, Almighty Shogun? Is it because... you did nothing at all after walking out of Tenshukaku and then came back in the evening?\" There was not a trace of reprimand to be heard in Masako's voice, but that made me even more ashamed when facing her questions. \"Alright then. Rest is also important. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll excuse myself. Enjoy your fill of the crab.\" Masako turns around and leaves.  </p> <p>Somehow, the Butter Crab today tasted like... nothing. Soon I'll know why. The Almighty Shogun is invincible, but the invincible Almighty Shogun could be defeated by a cold. Not long after I ate the Butter Crab, I collapsed into bed with a severe headache. The pain is nothing, but something more grievous has happened: On any other day, I could just rest my head on Masako's knees and fall asleep to her singing voice. But Masako isn't around today. My chamber feels icy-cold, but my forehead feels fiery-hot. This time, no one is sitting by my bedside.  </p> <p>She has her own matters to attend to. She is not only my kitsune but also the Guuji of the shrine. Maybe she is very mad now, or perhaps she is wondering if it is worthwhile to spend so much effort on the Shogun who always has the line \"Yay!\" upon her lips. With such a question in mind, I fall asleep.  </p> <p>I have a dream, in which Masako is still wearing her signature smile, a tea bowl in hand. \"I brewed this drink called Rainbow Aster. I just went to Ritou and bought some Calla Lilies from Mondstadt. Mix them with mint and we have this drink that can cure your cold. Now drink it.\" Perhaps because I am dreaming, I don't have the strength to brace myself up. \"Ah, looks like you can't support yourself. Allow me.\" She feeds me the Rainbow Aster in a way that I'd never dare to imagine. I wake with a start, my head still reeling from the sheer shock of the scene just now. Masako is probably still mad at me for slacking off.  </p> <p>It's just...

The Primordial One created shining shades of itself, and the number of these shades was four.</p> <p>\"On Phanes, or The Primordial One\" The Primordial One may have been Phanes. It had wings and a crown, and was birthed from an egg, androgynous in nature. But for the world to be created, the egg's shell had to be broken. However, Phanes, the Primordial One, used the eggshell to separate the \"universe\" and the \"microcosm of the world.\"</p> <p>\"Forty Years After the Held Branches\" Forty winters entombed the flames, and forty summers churned the seas. The Seven Sovereigns were vanquished, and the seven nations submitted to the heavens. The Primordial One, the great sovereign, began the creation of heaven and earth for \"our\" sake \u2014 that of its creations which it cherished most, who would soon appear upon this earth.</p> <p>...</p> <p>\"Four Hundred Years After the Held Branches\" The mountains and rivers were made, and the seas and oceans accepted those who rebelled and those who would not kneel. The Primordial One and one of its shades created the birds of the air, the beasts of the earth, and the fish of the sea. Together, they also created flowers, grass, and trees, before finally creating humans \u2014 our ancestors, numerous as the stars in the sky, uncountable as the sand on the shore. From that time, our ancestors made a covenant with the Primordial One, and so entered into a new age.</p> <p>\"The Year of the Ark's Opening\" The Primordial One had a sacred plan for humans. As long as they were happy, it too rejoiced.</p> <p>\"The Year After the Ark's Opening\" The people worked the land, and so came the first harvest. The people mined, and so reaped the first crop of precious ore. The people gathered, and the first poems were written.</p> <p>\"The Year of Jubilee\" If there was hunger, the heavens would bring down food and rain. If there was poverty, the earth would bring forth its riches. If melancholy were to spread, the heavens would reply with their voices. The one taboo was to succumb to temptation. But the path to temptation had already been sealed.</p> <p>...</p> <p>\"The Funerary Year\" The second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that conflict. The era of darkness had begun.</p> <p>\"The First Year of Darkness\" The people of the Seven Sovereigns had found refuge in the oceans, and the Dragonheirs of the Depths ruled this particular place, which led to war between them and our ancestors. Our ancestors chased them into the shadows with the light of a thousand lanterns, and they hid in those shadows, hunting us. But there was only darkness in this place, and so their hunting grounds were untrammeled. The prayers of the people turned into lamentations, but the Primordial One and its three other shining shades could not hear.</p> <p>\"The Parable of the Sun\" In a dark cavern, there lived a group of people who had never seen the light. Among them was a sage who had once seen the sun, and he told the gathered folk about what life under the sun was like, and about the great might of the sun. Seeing that they did not comprehend, he lit a torch \u2014 and thus did people come to worship the flame, believing it to be the sun. They even got used to a life of darkness and fire. When the sage died, someone would monopolize the flame. Using it, they would cast a long shadow over the land.</p> <p>\"The Parable of the Lethied Lotus\" A lotus that causes all who look upon it to forget their troubles. A ship captain searching for the way back to the surface discovered a tribe of people who ate these lotuses. Some crew members stayed in that place. Others rejected that temptation. Life is a boundless ocean of suffering. We are only searching for the way home.</p> <p>\"The Third Year of Darkness\" We knew the only one who had not forsaken us as the \"Ruler of Time.\" She was the moment. She was every moment. She was the measure of a thousand winds and the sun and the moon. She was every second of joy, every moment of rage, every instant of longing, every minute of obsession. She was every flash of delirium. We call her Kairos, or \"the ruler of the unchanging world.\" We dare not speak her true, secret name, and so I pen it here, only once, and in reverse: \"Htoratsi.\"</p> <p>\"The Year of Blindness\" The sage Abrax's wisdom was awakened, and he unveiled a light-bringing miracle from within his hands. So our ancestors began to build the Helios, with him as their leader.</p> <p>\"The Year of Sight, or the First Year of Sun and Moon\" Helios, the divine chariot of the sun, was finally completed. The Whitenight came, and Evernight was banished. The years of the Sun and Moon had begun.</p> <p>\"The Second Year of Sun and Moon\" Our ancestors sought the returning way, for surely the war on the surface had ended by then. But the Primordial One, the first throne, had laid down a ban, preventing our ancestors from finding the path home. In that case, the Primordial One must have defeated the Second Who Came. Abrax was imprisoned by order of the Sunchild.</p> <p>\"The Parable of the Tree\" The king's gardener and the tree spirit of the royal garden were in love. But the king wished to repair the beams of his pavilion, and so needed to cut down the tree with the most spiritual energy within it. The king was the incarnation of the Primordial One, and the gardener could not defy the sovereign of sovereigns, and so he could only bring his plea to the king's priest, who was the incarnation of Tokoyo Ookami. The priest had pity on the gardener and said to him: \"Go, and cut the branches of the spirit-tree down.\" The gardener did so, and afterward did as the king ordered, cutting the spirit-tree itself down. Then the priest said: \"Plant the spirit-tree's branches in the ground.\" But the gardener said: \"A spirit-tree shall take five hundred years to grow.\" The priest said: \"Your one thought shall echo through eternity.\" And so the gardener planted the branches in his back yard. In an instant, the slim branches grow into a new tree, and the new tree spirit was a continuation of the past one. For it is the God of Moments who is able to take \"seeds\" from this \"moment\" into the past and the future.</p> <p>The Tenth Year of Sun and Moon Abrax is long gone.

(This book has been constantly edited, redacted, and modified over the years. Even the name of the book's title has seen change from \"Aphotic Earth\" to \"Tokoyokoku,\" before becoming \"Byakuyakoku.\" Later, due to the grace of Watatsumi, the people of the depths would return to the sea's surface. But it seems like \"Aphotic Earth\" has some special meaning, and it has not been universally changed throughout the text.)  </p> <p>Of Wind and Water Byakuyakoku has no mountains to speak of, and so it is pointless to speak of them. However, our priests and sages have detected something. Even in these depths, the power of the \"undying wind\" and the \"water\" still remain. The personification of the \"undying wind\" is known as \"Tokoyo Ookami,\" and is poetically rendered \"the thousand winds\" or \"the thousand winds of time.\" \"Water,\" on the other hand, is the might of the Vishap Realm, represented by the Bathysmal Vishaps. We have already developed a certain field of study regarding the relationship between Sunfire, wind, and water. As such, both hydrology and the undying wind must be considered before undertaking any project of civil engineering.</p> <p>The Borders of Byakuyakoku The borders of Byakuyakoku are marked out by three corners. These mark the limits of the see-saw clash between humanity and the vishaps. During the era of Byakuyakoku, Towers of the Three Realms were built at these three corners, used to harmonize the three realms. Their ancient names have been lost to time, and they were renamed after the coming of Watatsumi. These towers are exceedingly important, and they are not in locations aligned with either wind or water. Rather, their purpose is to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and control its winds and waters. If these towers were to be imperiled, so would the entire nation. As such, they have been hidden using secret arts. Only the shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi can summon them forth.</p> <p>The Narrows The Narrows were, in the earliest times, sandwiched between the mountain face and an area known as the Roundlands, thus earning that location its name. However, the exceedingly strange tectonic shifts in Byakuyakoku caused the Roundlands to collapse into the depths, thus causing The Narrows to widen significantly.</p> <p>The Serpent's Heart From the first time our ancestors discovered this place, it had already played host to a unique phenomenon in which space itself might overlap in a certain locale. Later, those who came before us would utilize this phenomenon by creating the Serpent's Heart. It would be used to guard secrets, imprison criminals, and worship the great imaginary serpent, Ouroboros. In the earliest times, this place was called Delphi, the land of snakes. This name did not change even after the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami. Ancient art depicts the scaleless serpent as \"Ouroboros,\" and the coral-adorned serpent as \"Orobashi.\"</p> <p>Dainichi Mikoshi The earliest name of this place was \"Helios,\" and it was the high tower built by the sage Aberaku, standing for earth, the element between wind and water. According to prophecy, this was likely the sun that the sage displayed, used to light those lightless caverns. And just as those prophecies suggested, it was also later used to cast a great shadow over the nation.</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/The_Byakuyakoku_Collection/#vol-4-bathysmal-vishap-experimental-records","title":"Vol. 4 - Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Experimental Records of the Bathysmal Vishaps.

The Dragonheirs' (hereafter named Bathysmal Vishaps or plain vishaps) evolution is plain for all to see. (\"Water-101-Dragonheir Evolution: I\") We have tried lowering the temperature in the living environs of a young heat-resistant vishap. As a result, they were weaker once matured. We suspect that this is because its body did not possess the \"seed\" required to resist such an environment. However, its descendants would all possess high body fat, greater predilection towards sleep, and would express the Cryo element. (Please refer to the experimental data after the main text. The abnormal data derived from Sample 3 is due to my assistant feeling sorry for the subject of the anti-hunger control group and feeding it surreptitiously.) When we then placed their descendants into sweltering conditions, they would again choose, like their ancestors, the heat resistance trait. However, none of them have developed traits indicative of the Pyro element thus far. We do not have enough data to reach a conclusion at present, but we can make an educated guess that Bathysmal Vishaps have the ability to awaken their \"seed\" freely before maturation. Vishap mothers can also create new \"seeds\" to pass on to their descendants should they encounter heretofore unseen, challenging environments. It can be said that even before encountering us, the people of Enkanomiya, the Bathysmal Vishaps had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies. ...</p> <p>The results of the intelligence tests are astonishing. (\"Void-207-Vishap Intelligence Research\"). Through a screening process consisting of rewards and punishments (although previous research indicates that screening is unnecessary \u2014 vishaps are, one and all, adapters par excellence), the linguistic capacities of vishaps four generations down are starting to approach that of a 12-year-old human student. Perhaps it might be more accurate to say that vishaps always had their own methods of communication, and what they are displaying here is their ability to learn. We believe that these experiments should be stopped. If not, we may yet be proven narrow-minded for having dismissed that last person who wrote a fantastical tale about vishap-people. Prophecy holds that the Dragon Sovereign of Water will be born in a human form. We must not let this thing happen in Enkanomiya. ... All previous attempts at grafting have failed. (\"Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: I\"). Because they cannot accept Watatsumi Omikami's blood, the vishaps will fall victim to various adverse effects. Perhaps they are not yet strong enough, but we cannot be sure \u2014 indeed, according to our rationalized vishap evolutionary roadmap, we should have already bred the strongest vishap possible. ...</p> <p>The grafting can be considered a success. (\"Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: III\").

As a book from a transitory period, it uses Narukami-style names with Byakuyakoku subscripts.</p> <p>Question 1: What walks on four feet in the early morning, two feet during the day, and three feet at night? Answer: A vishap who transforms into a person to attend a ball, then breaks one of its legs and eventually ends up walking with a cane. Sages like this answer the most, and it is the children get it right almost exclusively. For adults, it always smells like a horrible conspiracy when a vishap turns into a human. According to a prophecy of old, the Dragon of Water, the ancient lord of vishaps, will definitely descend in the form of a human. However, for children, the answer to the question indicates the possibility of mutual understanding. But it is not a good idea to make vishaps sound adorable. Though such jokes defang the fear, they also lower the guard of the children. (Dragonheirs of the Depths have evolved to wield the power of other elements and have hence lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born from among their ranks.)</p> <p>Question 2: With only one mouth, this being sometimes has four feet, sometimes, two feet, and sometimes, three feet. Though unable to morph into other things, it is able to walk on the earth, swim in the water, and fly in the sky. The more feet it walks on, the feebler it grows. What is this being? Answer: A human. Humans crawl on hands and feet as babies, walk on two legs as adults, and use a cane as elders. The answer is undoubtedly \"a human.\"</p> <p>Question 3: What talks with only one mouth but walks on four and two feet? Answer: Someone raising livestock. This riddle is a very ancient one. In the past, we could only understand the meaning of livestock from reading texts. \"Four legs\" refers to four-legged animals like the Aux, Hors, and Foreste Bore. After Byakuyakoku fell into the ocean depths, these animals died out within two generations due to a lack of habitable land and food. Since the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami, some of us have returned to the sea's surface to build a home and interact with the people there. Therefore, we have been able to review the names of these animals. According to the Vassal and the Omikami's prophecy, we shall all move back to the sea's surface someday, so it is important to get these names right. Aux means cattle, Hors means horse, and Foreste Bore means forest boar.</p> <p>Question 4: Who are the two sisters who give birth to each other every day? Answer: Day and night, or Whitenight and Evernight. This riddle is easy to understand. It alludes to the succession of day and night, which in Byakuyakoku means the cyclical Whitenight and Evernight under the control of the Dainichi Mikoshi. Though the land was in everlasting night before the Dainichi Mikoshi was built, the light of day that people had seen has remained unchanged. By the way, the two special astronomical phenomena of Byakuyakoku \u2014 the mirages and the Sinshades \u2014 were at first indiscriminately referred to as Eidolons and seen as the two sides of the same coin. It was not until the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami that the people of Byakuyakoku were able to understand the two phenomena and name them differently. Though the sun did not shine upon Byakuyakoku, the mirages that appeared in Whitenights were named Sunfire Phantasms and those of Evernight, Ghostfire Phantasms. As time went by, both of them came to be referred to as Sunfire Phantasms, for they are essentially the same thing.</p> <p>Question 5: I am the Shadowborn of the Lord of Light. I am a wingless bird that rises from the earth to the sky. Those who shed tears in my presence feel no sorrow in their bosoms. Away with a gentle breeze I fade, and thus ends my fleeting life. Answer: The answer is smoke. Birds are winged creatures, and it is normal that they are not seen in Enkanomiya.</p> <p>Question 6: A father has twelve children, each then giving birth to sixty daughters of different appearances. Of them, thirty are pale and thirty are dark. The whole family, knowing not death, will only fade away. Who is the father? Answer: The answer is the year. The people of Byakuyakoku may find the part about sixty pale or dark granddaughters a bit confusing. But everything will start to make sense once they crack Question 4. There used to be a sequel to this riddle in ancient times. It roughly said that every granddaughter would give birth to twelve descendants, and each of them would then have sixty children. Every such child later would give birth to another sixty, who would go on to have children of their own. This would continue until at last, all the offspring would together give birth to the one and only primordial child \u2014 Tokoyo Ookami, the \"mother\" of fourteen billion years.

Many of these millennia-old folksongs tell of a shrine maiden by the name of Mouun, who once rode upon the back of a sea monster, following the Great Serpent unto a tragic, moving end.</p> <p>The shrine maiden Mouun was born to the Yuna Clan. This clan was one of the great houses that first followed their Omikami out into the sunlight, and is still known today for their traditional talent in whalesongs and their closeness with all marine life. Mouun entered Sangonomiya Shrine at a young age and would learn the etiquette and ritual arts of the Watatsumi shrine maidens, history, governance, and the island folk-tunes. Her younger twin sister Ayame, who in later days would be known as \"Umigozen,\" was a female diver, making a living through collecting pearls. By the time news that the Shogunate had unified all the Inazuman islands reached Watatsumi, Mouun and Ayame were already quite famous among the island's people. In the folk-tunes that still persist till today, Mouun was a wise and gentle soul who helped to steer the people away from meaningless conflict, while Ayame was valiant and cheerful, her power sufficient to wrestle against fierce sea creatures.  </p> <p>When Watatsumi Omikami ceased in his hesitation and embarked on that hopeless eastern expedition, Sangonomiya's first navy was entrusted by the then-Divine Priestess to Mouun and her sister. This was also the beginning of Mouun's association with the giant whale named \"Daikengyou.\"  </p> <p>Legend has it that Daikengyou was a huge blind whale that had lived for five hundred years and four hundred years before that. The dark depths of the ocean floor were its home, and the fishes of the deep and the moonglow-beauteous jellyfish were its faithful servants. Five hundred narwhals guarded its left flank and five hundred humpback whales played music to its right. Some folk-tunes claim that it could have swallowed ten coral islands in one gulp before spitting out five skerries in its deep, satiated slumber.  </p> <p>Even amongst those of the Watatsumi people who were skilled in whalesong, none had faced this titan and returned whole to tell the tale. But at the Divine Priestess' direction, Mouun dived deep into the whale's phosphorescent palace just as the moon rose high enough to pierce the ocean mists. None knew how Mouun persuaded Daikengyou to join her. But on the third moonrise after her departure, when the waves drew back from the shore, the people witnessed Daikengyou surface from the tranquil ocean, shimmering with silver light as it bore Mouun on its back.  </p> <p>Later, Daikengyou and its marine courtiers would follow Mouun and her sister into battle at Omikami's side, though the battle ultimately and inexorably went ill... Mouun made to retreat when she heard that Omikami and Touzannou had been slain together, but she was ambushed by the tengu Sasayuri's subordinates en route and was herself slain together with Daikengyou the mighty whale, their remains captured by the Shogunate. As for her sister, \"Umigozen\" Ayame, she disappeared into the blood-red ocean after a valiant stand, never to be seen again.</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Toki_Alley_Tales/","title":"Toki Alley Tales","text":"<p>Author: Takizawa Kyouden</p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Toki_Alley_Tales/#prologue-the-tanukis-oral-history-of-inazuma","title":"Prologue: The Tanuki's Oral History of Inazuma","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>They say that in the past, when the fragile and short-lived mortals had yet to cross over the sea unto these lands, Inazuma was once a land that belonged to the tanuki.

She rents a shop there that sells alcohol and lives a leisurely existence.  </p> <p>I say \"leisurely.\" That's putting it nicely. \"Completely and utterly chaotic\" would be a more accurate description.  </p> <p>In theory, someone who enjoys alcohol enough to start a business selling it should know a thing or two about it. This applies as much to youkai as to humans. But to be absolutely blunt, Yoichi has terrible taste in alcohol and has no business sense at all. Worst of all, in all her days in the human realm, she has never ridden herself of her awful tengu habits. Sometimes she will get drunk and stir up trouble among other youkai or kidnap human children and parade around all night at the festival, causing total chaos. Other times, she will barge into a theater, with no regard for the atmosphere, then casually strut on stage and start beating up the lead actor... the list goes on. If it weren't for her senior status among the youkai and her extensive connections in human society, I suspect Yoichi might have been dealt with by some hero or other at the foot of a mountain long ago. But the youkai and human folk of Toki Alley see her quite differently. Even the Great Gongen has never given her serious punishment, because she has never caused any major trouble.  </p> <p>Though haughty and slovenly by nature, as a \"great youkai, set apart from the common folk\" (her own words), Yoichi isn't greatly attached to worldly possessions. Any money she comes into is spent swiftly on alcohol \u2014 or else on novels from Yae Publishing House, which she skims through halfway before promptly defenestrating them. As a result, her home is not what you would call \"domesticated\" \u2014 quite the opposite, in fact.  </p> <p>Simply put, she doesn't have any worldly possessions of sentimental value... the sole exception being the golden paper fan she wears on her waist.  </p> <p>The Great Tengu are a race of monsters that travels to many different worlds, and it's not at all uncommon for them to adorn themselves with battle trophies that have an interesting backstory. Such is the case for this paper fan. On a moonlit night, a drunken Yoichi, her shirt collar wide open, began bragging to me about its story...  </p> <p>She said that in one of the many worlds she had traversed, she took the form of a haughty young male archer, serving under an equally haughty shogun. Under that shogun's command, she, \u2014 or rather, \"he\" \u2014 had proudly shot down countless opponents, including big-bellied mortal samurai and crafty tanuki ninjas. Even the jikininki, despite their bulky figures, were no match against a single shot from Yoichi's bow.  </p> <p>\"Hahahahaha! You are truly a great soldier! Your vision is keen like lightning, just like the Great Tengu!\" At that age, the conceited shogun tended to laugh in a loud and obnoxious manner, which was most unseemly. After that, Yoichi made numerous contributions for the shogun, executing many monsters and unfortunate mortals. It goes without saying that she probably made some of the stories up. But what she truly became renowned for was the final battle of that world, a world in which she spent a hundred years.  </p> <p>In that naval battle, the shogun and rebels braved storms to fight bloody battles between the straits. The monsters numbered at least eight million, maybe eight million more than that, while the mortal samurai must have numbered in the tens of millions. In terms of casualties, the headcount cannot be known, but what is known is that 800 thousand ships sank in the course of the battle. Yoichi reached this staggering tally with my assistance as she was vomiting up a bellyfull of wine by the window.  </p> <p>As is typical of so many stories about bitterly fought wars stuck in stalemate, brave heroes from both sides mowed down their enemies like blades of grass, painting the sea blood-red, while the rival generals stubbornly refused to back down, preferring to stay locked in intransigence than to withdraw their troops and head home to get a good night's sleep.  </p> <p>Finally, on one cold moonlit night, a small boat slowly floated out from enemy lines. A lone figure stood on the boat, swaying like a reflection in the water. Beside the figure was a shimmering flagpole with a paper fan at the top. It gave off a golden glow in the moonlight.  </p> <p>\"Argh, ARGH... I am furious, furious! This blatant provocation cannot be tolerated!\" The shogun squinted his eyes, saw the golden fan in the distance, and instantly flew into a rage.  </p> <p>Yoichi couldn't understand why the shogun's self-esteem was so fragile, but was too lazy to empathize with the petty mortal sense of dignity. At that moment, she... no, \"he,\" fixed his keen tengu gaze on the floating figure in the boat.  </p> <p>What he saw was a woman, and an altogether different one than Yoichi.  </p> <p>Moments later, a single arrow flew across the moon and tore apart the night sky.  </p> <p>\"Haha, great!\" Soon, the shogun's shouting was drowned out by the cheers of the army.  </p> <p>\"If those two old-timers find out what they have lost, they'd probably be so angry they'd rupture their spleens!\" Yoichi let out a conceited and mischievous laugh. She was drunk. The Great Tengu had a certain twinkle in her eye, of the rather repulsive variety, that she made no attempt to cover up.  </p> <p>What had happened was that as the arrow flew through the air, Yoichi had already spread out her giant wings and flown across the strait, snatching the golden paper fan and the bewildered beauty holding onto it as she passed over the boat. She then took the opportunity to push over the insufferably loud-mouthed shogun and flew away from the battle. A perfect tengu snatch and grab. It was just a shame that... \"Well, you know what happened, she was a neko. She scratched me to pieces...\" Yoichi stuck out her tongue and sighed with exasperation.  </p> <p>\"Oh right, it's snapper season! You should take some back with you.\" \"Hmm? The stingy Great Tengu has a heart?\" \"I meant for that woman!\" Seeing the threatening gaze from the greatly tipsy Great Tengu, I hastily gathered the remaining snapper in my arms and left.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Inazuma/Toki_Alley_Tales/#vol-2-osens-tale","title":"Vol. 2 - Osen's Tale","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Mother once warned that a beautiful face can hide deceptive intentions.

When the night is pitch black and the moon has climbed to its peak, the neko awaken from their slumber. It is said that neko who have lived up for hundreds or even thousand of years can easily take on the form of a young woman, tempting people into doing funny and foolish things or chasing innocent travelers out of some sense of spiteful vengeance. But that's just the stuff of mortal imagination. In fact, the bake-neko only take on the form of young women when they're especially angry. Most of the time, they prefer to take on the form of an older woman, partly because it matches their crafty and cantankerous nature, but also because they can use old age as a disguise, portraying themselves as gentle souls to poor, unsuspecting passers-by.  </p> <p>\"Hey, that's not free!\" At the sound of the voice, I raised my head to see a young woman sitting on the eaves, as if she'd been waiting there for a while. Her face was obscured in the shadows, and all I could make out was something resembling a smile on her face and the golden-green light reflected by her eyes. Moonlight flowed from her semi-exposed shoulders down her dress, trickling through the gaps in the hem of her skirt and outlining her long, slender legs with a porcelain-white luster. She was absent-mindedly playing with a kendama in her hand.  </p> <p>Yep, the old lady was definitely furious...  </p> <p>\"Tut-tut, you're late again tonight.\" \"Of course, s\u2014sorry.\"  </p> <p>Mosquitoes kept bumping into the paper lamp, causing it to flicker lethargically in response.

Now, despite my being a tanuki on friendly-enough terms with the tengu to sit and drink with them, even I have to be on my very best behavior around the bake-neko. So, I promptly prostrated myself and apologized profusely for my transgression.  </p> <p>\"Never mind, never mind. Since the snapper is still fresh, you can get up.\" With great difficulty on account of my rotund tanuki form, I resumed a normal seated position. The young woman slowly transformed back into an old woman, who had a kindly but strange smile on her face. \"Thank you, Auntie Sen.\" Call me Osen!  </p> <p>I was relieved. But something still felt off.  </p> <p>\"Hahahaha, anyway, how's that fool doing these days?\" With a slurp, Osen swallowed one of the fish whole, including the tail.  </p> <p>As for the story of how her fate became intertwined with that of the Great Tengu, the facts can only be described as farcical. We have already heard the ridiculous tale from Yoichi's perspective, but the bake-neko tells a completely different story.  </p> <p>Osen wasn't born in our world, but in one where mortals were much more savage. One night, in a bamboo forest, the young Osen was captured by a wandering monk. After passing through many hands, she was eventually sold to the shogun and became some sort of \"Obake-Neko.\" She has few memories of those days beyond wondering why the high-ranking officials of the mortal world enjoyed annoying her and playing with her. Every day, she was driven to scratch her enemies to pieces, or forced to play boring games which only they seemed to enjoy. This went on for such a long time that any normal person would have been driven to madness. But youkai live such long lives that they have far more patience than mortals.  </p> <p>Later, when her shogun and the rebels' shogun started fighting, Osen transformed into a ninja.  </p> <p>\"This is where the story gets even more boring...\" Osen squinted her eyes as she said this, letting out a huge yawn that stretched from ear to ear.  </p> <p>On the night of that naval battle, the shogun thought of an ingenious scheme... The shogun ordered Osen to transform into a beautiful young woman and stand on a small boat with a golden fan to humiliate the rebels so that they dare not approach. Even if they did, the bake-neko would teach them a brutal lesson.  </p> <p>But of course, Yoichi was standing amidst the ranks of the rebels... \"But of course, that fool suddenly stood up and starting ranting and raving about shooting down the fan with a single arrow.\" Then, the Great Tengu... \"...Slipped and fell, landing in the ocean with a great big splash.\" The old woman's feline face failed to stifle a smile, and erupted into jeering laughter.  </p> <p>\"She was so drunk that night that she thought the seas were the stormiest she'd ever seen. In fact, the moon shone calmly and coolly, and there was not a trace of wind.\" \"But, it'd been a few hundred years since I'd seen someone so entertaining. So, to save her the humiliation, I stifled my laughter and took the paper fan down myself... Then, a roar of cheers came from their fleet. Just thinking about it amuses me to this day...\"  </p> <p>Next, the Great Tengu unfurled her gigantic wings and leaped into the air, like a cloud covering the moon, and swooped down towards the beautiful woman... \"A flurry of arrows later, and she fell into the sea looking like a hedgehog. I couldn't keep a straight face any longer and started laughing uncontrollably.\" Laughing raucously, Osen dragged the ill-fated tengu from the sea, put her in a headlock, and flew over the fleets from both sides, laughing manically and causing both generals to lose their tempers. People say she flew over eight ships in an row, then disappeared into the night. The feline youkai's laughter could be heard for more than three days after the battle had finished.  </p> <p>\"I couldn't stop laughing, so I scratched her as hard as I could... But the sorry state she was in made me laugh even harder, and the harder I scratched, the harder I laughed, hahahahaha...\" The neko transformed into an old lady and laughed uncontrollably.  </p> <p>\"Afterwards, she brought me to this world and treated me like I was some kind of trophy!\" The old woman pursed her lips as her face transformed into that of a sulky young woman. But this looked quite comical, because her cheeks were still flushed bright red from having laughed so hard she could barely breathe. \"I am NOT a trophy!\"  </p> <p>\"Hmm, now I think about it, that's probably the whole reason why she doesn't dare to visit me herself.\" The elderly female with feline features and the face of a young woman sighed gently, then smiled a cunning smile once more.  </p> <p>\"You should go.

In the elegant courtyard, even the cicadas' chirps were silenced. There was only the quiet trickle of water droplets in the suikinkutsu, accompanied by the rhythmic thumps of the shishi-odoshi. Long ago, in the mountains and forests where youkai could lead carefree lives, the lady who could turn mist into rain was a good friend of the tanuki and kitsune.

Those who dare to look directly into these woeful eyes will be lost forever in the incomprehensible fog of rain. Of course, that's just a silly legend among mortals, but the basic etiquette like \"Don't look into the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna\" is indeed an unwritten rule among youkai.  </p> <p>\"Thank you.\" Granny Ame's voice was as soft and gentle as ever, like morning dew in the mist.  </p> <p>She didn't invite me in, nor did she share her story.

However, due to the great popularity of another book known colloquially as \"Raiden Reincarnation,\" many people became interested in stories of this kind. This book thus wound up being published in a haphazard manner.</p> <p>It is often said that the \"drawn bow is like the quartered moon, and studying the blade is like a circle of transparent jade.\"  </p> <p>It is said that when Narukami came to her people, she brought with her the knowledge of crafting swords. After thousands of years and hundreds of bountiful harvests, mortal swordsmiths were at last able to make swords that would please even Narukami herself. Thus did the Grand Shrine and the Shogunate enact this divine ceremony: they collected the greatest swords in the world and offered them up to the shrine, thus naming these blades \"Goshintou.\" This ceremony was a very lively one indeed, and the practice persists to the present period. However, there are many behind-the-curtain matters concerning the \"Goushintou\" that few know of. No famous craftsman merely forges one blade in one sitting. The greatest of their works are known as \"Shinuchi,\" and are given a lovely name before being offered to the craftsman's lord or deity. These are not built for taking lives and are to remain pure. The others are known as \"Kageuchi\" and will be given to retainers for them use as weapons. These will often be used to shed blood and will thus be stained with impurity and filth.  </p> <p>From the day Narukami Gongen, the First Shogun, began her dominion over the land of Inazuma, she was accompanied by her younger twin sister. \"Shin\" and \"Kage,\" light and dark they were, mediating and holding court, ordering and giving battle. The younger of the two was named \"Ei,\" and if her name were to be written plainly, it would likely be the word for \"shadow,\" which she was in relation to the first Shogun, to whom she would become the successor. As most know, only The Seven emerged from the wrack and ruin of the war that rolled across the mortal world like a crimson storm. Though the Shadow Shogun was divinely skilled in martial arts and unsurpassed with the blade, she believed herself little more than a warrior with little understanding of mortal hearts.

It is said that the one fortunate enough to catch it will enjoy a year of good luck: business owners will see their wealth increase, the poor will see their fortunes turn around, the single will encounter their fated partners, and the married will see their shared life blossom with mutual love and appreciation, never again to descend into petty squabbles over life's daily vexations.  </p> <p>While some brides use a real flower ball, many alternatives exist depending on the family's wealth. The rich tend to use woven balls with silk from the Silk Flower, while the poor fashion theirs from colored paper or cloth. But the custom itself is observed in the same fashion at all of Liyue's weddings, even though the fortunes of individual families may differ.  </p> <p>Some say the Liyue custom was originally adopted from the Ludi Harpastum festival celebrated in the neighboring Wind Kingdom of Mondstadt. Others say it dates back to before the Archon War, when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue.

In any case, following her return to the elements, it is conceivable that her followers spread across Liyue, took this custom with them, and taught it to the locals. The people of Liyue being a competitive and fun-loving folk, they may then have adapted it and embellished upon it to suit their own preferences.  </p> <p>Despite being a benign and joyful celebration at heart, security logs from the Millelith indicate that the throwing of flower balls is responsible for a significant number of injuries every year.

In this way, mortals were guided along the path towards prosperity and to triumph over the obstacles that lay in their way, and thus did the domain of the Geo Archon remain strong and steadfast.  </p> <p>When peace returned once more after the Archon War, the city of Liyue Harbor began to flourish under the government of the Qixing, who represented every trade in Liyue, and who also acted as intermediaries between mortals and their god, taking responsibility for communicating with the Geo Archon, explaining his divine predictions to the people in clear and simple terms, and issuing the official policy for the forthcoming year.  </p> <p>Naturally, the illustrious individual tasked with hosting the Rite of Descension can only be chosen from among the Qixing, and no one other than that person is permitted to intervene in the proceedings.  </p> <p>In the minds of the many merchants of Liyue Harbor, the divine predictions of Rex Lapis are more precious than the metals and minerals of the mountain mines.  </p> <p>Thus, no matter how far from home they may have strayed by the day that Rex Lapis descends, all will seek to make the journey back in person, or at least send someone in their place, so that they may receive the guidance of the Geo Archon and safeguard their financial fortunes for the year ahead.  </p> <p>The raving-mad sages of the nation of rainforests drive themselves to hysterics as they abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of elusive and esoteric wisdom, but the people of the land of karst cliffs are accustomed to welcoming the generous guidance of their deity as a means towards a worldly end \u2014 namely, their continued prosperity.  </p> <p>It would seem that, while The Seven stand shoulder-to-shoulder in their roles as Archons of the mortal realm, there are moments where their paths diverge, and even run directly counter to one another.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Customs_of_Liyue/#vol-3-silk-flowers","title":"Vol. 3 - Silk Flowers","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A book on the cultures and customs of Liyue originally compiled by Fadhlan, a scholar from Sumeru residing in Liyue. It was then edited by many local scholars and published. It is one of the bestsellers in Liyue.</p> <p>For the well-to-do citizens of Liyue, the Silk Flower has a ubiquitous presence in their lives: It has a beautiful color and its soft petals can be processed to make silk. It also has a most delightful scent that can survive multiple rounds of processing, and even the weaving process itself. For this reason, Liyue's botanists have cultivated a special strain for exclusive use in perfume making \u2014 with the most luxurious perfumes being offered first and foremost, of course, to Rex Lapis for his approval.  </p> <p>For the women of Liyue, highly prized Silk Flower perfumes are seen as holding different symbolic meanings based on the fragrance profile and composition. The unwritten rule in Liyue is that it is impolite to broach the topic of perfume with a woman in normal social interaction, but also that if an admirer is able to correctly guess the type of perfume one is wearing, as well as correctly deduce its unique properties and characteristics, all whilst conveying this in an articulate and tactful manner, the admirer is more likely to stand a chance of winning one's affection.  </p> <p>A popular belief in the rural regions of Liyue is that the method for decocting Silk Flower perfume was originally taught to mortals by an adeptus living as a hermit on Mt. Aocang. In the age where divine beings coexisted alongside lowly mortals, the adeptus guided humans to learn the ways of courting and romancing from the birds, beasts, and plants. To a young woman bathing in a spring, it once took the form of a graceful illuminated bird, teaching her the exotic techniques of decocting and applying fragrant oils.  </p> <p>Who was this young woman capable of stirring the heart of an adeptus living in deliberate seclusion from the world? With countless legends offering different versions of the story, the truth is impossible to know. But the art of decocting perfume from Silk Flowers was indeed passed on, for it survives to this very day. It is claimed that the subtle undertones of the perfume's scent and the gentle-but-nimble hand techniques used in the decoction process have remained unchanged throughout history on account of having proved themselves supremely fit for purpose time and time again.  </p> <p>As they grow, Silk Flowers will exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from their ancestral habitat. Liyue's merchants have coined plenty of tasteless terms for Silk Flowers of all types and uses. They tend to attribute them to Rex Lapis, claiming they once had the fortune to encounter him during one of his excursions in the mortal realm or pass them off as a merciful gift from an adeptus, such details always featuring as part of a wondrous, fantastical narrative. Sales tactics like these always manage to garner the interest of a shopper or two on their way through Liyue Harbor.  </p> <p>High demand has pushed Liyue's merchants towards the mass cultivation of Silk Flowers and the ongoing breeding of new strains. This means that the striking sight of beautiful Silk Flowers is a common one in all highly populated areas, including the city and the towns. Sadly, geographical changes over Liyue's long history and ever-expanding mining activity have conspired to destroy the natural habitat of wild Silk Flowers, meaning that the flower is all but extinct in rural areas. The handful that can still be found in the wild are carefully looked after by adepti living in seclusion there. These Silk Flowers feature daintier, more elegant blossoms, which puts them in stark contrast to those cultivated by horticulturalists in urban centers.  </p> <p>Interestingly, the people of Liyue see the pretty and sweet-smelling Silk Flower as one of the many symbols of Rex Lapis. Which begs the question: Has this mighty and imposing god, who typically takes a decidedly masculine form on his excursions to the mortal realm, ever taken the form of a woman and accepted a ritual offering in the form of a bunch of flowers? The sparse historical records on the one hand and the plethora of rumors of obscure origin on the other means that, while this claim is more or less impossible to verify, it also cannot be simply dismissed as baseless speculation.  </p> <p>On a personal note \u2014 the writer has, on one occasion, personally witnessed a Statue of The Seven accept a carefully prepared and distinctly feminine gift that was presented to it in worship. As for the Geo Archon's innermost feelings upon receiving offerings from their subjects, however, this is not something that I, as an outsider in Liyue, consider myself qualified to comment on.</p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Humor_From_Tianheng/","title":"Humor From Tianheng","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A poetry collection by Pingshan, The Mystic.

The wielders of the Ominous Swords who had turned into ferocious demons? Or Mir who could somewhat hold his own in a fight?  </p> <p>\"Yum. Very nice.\" Now that the spirit had possessed her body, Weiyang was of a much sweeter and gentler disposition. She took a tiny bite of one of Mir's stuffed pies, but it was too hot, so in an effort to avoid burning her tongue she stuck it out of her mouth and panted for breath frantically. Truth be told, it was all rather cute. \"That came unexpectedly. I need some time to process.\" Mir, who had given up one of his eyeballs to appease the spirit, helped himself to a pie and asked, \"Can you go over it again?\" \"Very well. The 'meteorite' was in fact a Divine Halberd. It was snapped into pieces by a commoner and made into nine cursed swords \u2014 the Ominous Swords. This one is the Sword of Mist, adding in that pair I've found three of them to date.\" \"And what's your place in all of this?\" \"I was once the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. But I have long forgotten my name. I was in charge of conducting trials and sentencing at the end \u2014 a judge, to use your parlance.\" Since the Court of Imperial Entertainments was responsible for sacrifices and offerings, Mir's father had forced him to learn every last detail and word uttered in every known court ritual. And because most rituals involved encounters with bizarre forces and temperamental deities, he also knew a thing or two about how to deal with them. For instance, he knew that deities tended to guard their names closely, for knowledge of a deity's true name allows a human being to exercise absolute control over them. So he wasn't convinced this one had simply forgotten her name.  </p> <p>\"So the court wants to retrieve the swords to reconstruct the Divine Halberd?\" Mir forced himself to entertain the reasonability of this line of inquiry. \"I don't know. The master of this body knows nothing else. She is just... deeply angry. She wants to prove herself.\" Weiyang puts her hands on her chest. \"So what's the next step? Do I have to perform some sort of farewell ceremony for you?\" Mir stroked the bandaged and sightless eye. \"And then do I get my eye back?\"  </p> <p>\"Give me a name.\" She raised her head, oblivious to the crumbs at the edges of her mouth. \"Don't be ridiculous. The imperial civil service examinations are overseen in person by the Emperor himself. How will I claim the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets with only one eye?\" \"Well, I have things to reclaim too: the remaining pieces of the Divine Halberd,\" she responded. \"Otherwise, this world and everything in it is going to burn in hellfire.\" Mir kept looking at her, but did not respond. \"You do not need to go with me. But with the fate of all living things at stake, please allow me to hold on to your eyeball for the time being.\"  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Legend_of_the_Shattered_Halberd/#vol-3-a-dark-westward-journey","title":"Vol. 3 - A Dark Westward Journey","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>\"Just stay with the name 'Weiyang' for convenience's sake on the road. With the official documents from the government in hand, you should be free to go as you wish throughout the kingdom.\" Still worried about Weiyang, Mir decided to accompany her on her journey and kill any demons they may encounter. Though they had already collected five Ominous Swords and all seemed to be well, they knew in their hearts that the way forward would only get more treacherous and perilous.  </p> <p>\"This is all that I can do for you,\" Mir said as he placed a series of dishes onto the table. He then sat down opposite Weiyang. Weiyang's right arm, which was broken in the fight to the death that had just taken place, was still wrapped in bandages. She stared intensely at Mir for a long while, but Mir just sat there resting his jaw on his hand and looking downwards. Neither of them spoke. Finally, Weiyang attempted to use chopsticks with her left hand. But alas, her dexterity was found wanting, and she failed to procure a single meatball from the murky depths of the hot broth. Mir sighed, took the chopsticks from her hand, and said, \"Fine, I'll feed you.\" \"So there is still more that you can do for me,\" Weiyang suddenly quipped a few mouthfuls in. Her mood remained unchanged. \"The Court of Imperial Entertainments is dedicated to worshiping and making sacrifices to all of you divine beings up above. Serving you is my family's job.\" And in any case, when the gods make their move, what can mere mortals do but look on helplessly and accept their fate? \u2014 At least, that's what Mir thought. But he also thought it was better to keep that part to himself.  </p> <p>\"Couldn't you use your powers, though? I thought you said that each time you fight a Ominous Sword owner, you use telekinesis to make your polearm levitate, swing your sword around, and so on. Surely chopsticks can't be any harder?\" \"That is a power bestowed upon me by my father. Only I have this power. It is solely for use in sentencing the guilty. I mustn't...\" Weiyang's voice changed in tone. \"I mustn't use it lightly.\" \"Before he died, that guy said something really strange about the situation with my father.\" Mir flicked the candle flame while he spoke to relieve his boredom. \"'Minister Mi was neither innocent, nor wrongly accused.' What on earth did he mean by that?\" If the court was unwilling to reconstruct the Divine Halberd, then being with the celestial emperor's daughter that had possessed Weiyang's body makes him an enemy of the imperial court. As if to signal that she had understood what Mir was thinking, Weiyang's face grew dark in the candlelight. She said, \"You don't need to help me any longer. You are a mere mortal, there is nothing to be gained from settling a score with the court.\" Mir replied, \"Speak no more of this matter. I must get the truth out of my old man first.\" Weiyang said, \"Oh... We will pay a visit to your esteemed father? Then I must buy some fresh silk garments and makeup first thing tomorrow morning.\" Mir replied, \"He's just a regular old man. There's no need for all that.\" An unusually stern expression appeared on Weiyang's face. \"Is this not your sworn duty?\"  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Legend_of_the_Shattered_Halberd/#vol-4-master-plan","title":"Vol. 4 - Master Plan","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>\"Calm down, my son. Listen, Mir. I am not your real father...\" \"Noooooo!\" The once Minister of Imperial Banquets was, in truth, Khan the Asura from Jotunheim. Leaving the capital was but an act in collaboration with the Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary to protect the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. \"The late Celestial Emperor Shenxiao, the now Contra Mundi, was once a dear friend of mine. But now, knowing that you have successfully summoned her, all my wishes have been fulfilled.\"  </p> <p>Even a Buddha or an adeptus would have found themselves powerless to do anything in this situation. \"This is the Sword of Flame, the 'Katakugosha.' It was made from the shard of the Divine Halberd that was the Dharani of the fire realm. Sorry... in language that Your Majesty would understand, it's made with the runes of the fire realm, one of the God King's nine realms.\" How could this westbound warrior display such mastery of the sword? Most who had been stripped of their intellect by an Ominous Sword lose their fighting instinct and any martial arts they had learned. Weiyang nursed her broken arm and panted in the scorching hot air. Normally her abilities would enable her to fix broken bones, but the unquenchable flames burnt relentlessly at her wound. Her sight grew blurry as she lost blood. Mir stepped in front of her, guarding her from the warrior. \"I can see that you have a lot of questions. Fine, I'll tell you everything! I killed your father because he tried to stop the resurrection of the God King. And the reason I can manipulate the fire realm runes rather than the other way round is because...\" The warrior from the east raised the Ominous Sword. \"Is because I am a warrior of Hunt From Above made flesh...\" Legend has it that the Celestial Emperor once went to war with the Asura. To prepare for the war, the Celestial Emperor selected soldiers from three realms and made them ascend to become his celestial army after death. Sometimes, they were beset by inclement weather on the marsh, with thundercloud tornadoes surrounding them. The people of Zhongzhou referred to it as the soldiers of the celestial army \"hunting from above.\"  </p> <p>\"No... Impossible!\" A look of disbelief appeared on the warrior's face as the Ominous Sword broke into pieces, and he, too, was sent flying from his own shoulders towards whatever destiny had in store for him next. In the chaos, Mir had brought out the sword his father had left him as inheritance. It was intended as more of a gesture of defiance than a genuine attempt to fight back. But unbeknownst to him, this was the greatest cursed sword of all, that had once burned the entire world to cinders: Laevatain. If the fire-realm runes constituted the mystery of the fire realm, Laevatain was its pure, unadulterated, unquenchable reality. The sword had extinguished after the world was burned, but having assimilated the rune of the fire realm, it burned bright once more.  </p> <p>\"The whole world... destroyed again...\" Weiyang fell unconscious as she spoke.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Legend_of_the_Shattered_Halberd/#vol-5-legacy-of-a-goddess","title":"Vol. 5 - Legacy of a Goddess","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>\"There are many among the military officials who wish to unseal Axis Mundi since the world in chaos would greatly elevate the position and importance of the Martial Artists.\" \"They want to wage another War of the Asuras?\" \"He does.\" The tug-of-war between the civil and military officials and the schemes of the past gods once again threatens all of the nine realms!  </p> <p>\"Your deeds have saved the people.

Grand Secretary will be yours too within a decade, if you want it.\" The crown prince sat down. \"Well?

The Dharani of the fire realm, I will offer to father. Mostly to avoid another situation where we have remnants trying to stir up trouble.\" \"Can't, uh, can't hurt. As long as the portion I get looks the part it'll be fine. This is gonna be known as the new national superweapon!

She was not implicated in the evil plot by her father, the Imperial Grand Minister. The Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary both testified.

The penchant of people is to pursue profit, and when people turn their means to profitable ends, wealth is created. To possess means is to possess power, and to curb the unjust excesses of power, we restrain it with contracts to guide all things to prosper together. The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course \u2014 this is the just and upright way.</p> <p>Some say: \"There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?\"</p> <p>This question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity \u2014 but the treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous.</p> <p>Hence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government.

This was a story that the village elders had never told them before. Perhaps it was a legend that even the eldest of elders had never heard before.

The Sea God took her along a corridor of great columns, formed from the skeleton of a dead whale, that led to a palatial gate adorned with shining pearls and iridescent shells. Finally, the young bride had arrived at the palace the Sea God had made for her. The palace that was to be her new home.</p> <p>\"It was not my plan to meddle in the affairs of common people,\" came the god's voice rippling through the water.

Somewhere they could call home.\"</p> <p>But this young woman did not want a new home decorated with prize pearls and rare shells. The dazzling spectacle of the ocean floor \u2014 and the creatures that she knew lurked in the darkness \u2014 filled her not with peace, but with dread.

It's quite a page-turner. This segment is on the origin of Wuwang Hill.</p> <p>Hiding between the jagged peaks in the north of Mt. Qingce is a slope known as Wuwang Hill, a palpably ominous place and the setting of many tales of supernatural phenomena. It is rumored by Liyue that the spirits of the dead lurk within the woods on Wuwang Hill. They roam the perimeter of the decrepit village, wandering among the withering trees and rotting foliage, eternally yearning for things left unresolved in living years. These floating spirits often entice unsuspecting passers-by away from the main path and onto treacherous mountain tracks that leads them tumbling into a river or straight into an ambush of ravenous monsters.</p> <p>It is this phenomenon from which Wuwang Hill derives its name. Wuwang means \"prudence\" in the common tongue, and Wuwang Hill is said to be \"the hill where the prudent are punished.\" For even those travelers who do not act rashly or impulsively on their journey are doomed to be ensnared by the malevolence that lingers here like the mist in the mountain air.</p> <p>Both innocent villagers and ignorant visitors alike are susceptible to the deception of the Wuwang Hill spirits, which draw them deep into dark woods where thick mist blots out the sky and unknown dangers lurk in the shadows. There are many means by which these sinister spirits are able to deceive mortals. Some take the form of bereavement or grief, others of regret, manifesting as voices and visages of the deceased, the love of the departed, or the remorse of another party in an unresolved dispute. The traveler finds themselves compelled to heed the spirit's cry, and follows them into the depths of Wuwang.</p> <p>But Wuwang Hill was not always this way. Some signs of life remained there up until relatively recently, and in times gone by the village at the foot of the slope enjoyed a peaceful and leisurely existence, the chimneys always smoking and the lanterns always lit. That same village stands abandoned today... The buildings are in ruins and all that remains of the villagers is the indistinct murmuring from a realm beyond.</p> <p>There is a fable that is oft-repeated among the children of Qingce Village. It holds that the young people of Wuwang Hill, enchanted by the whale-like song of a faraway sea monster, all threw themselves into the gently flowing Bishui River in pursuit of false promises and childlike dreams. Along the river they floated, making their way to the Sea of Clouds, where they became one with the waves and lost all memory of the woods and their village on the hill... Their dreams, meanwhile, became the sea monster's song. Generation after generation of young people disappeared in this way, until in the end, the sole remaining residents of Wuwang Hill were old and gray. One by one, they left this mortal plane amidst sighs of grief. The bright lights of Liyue Harbor, Rex Lapis's pride and joy, burned ever brighter, while another neglected mountain village turned into a silent ghost town.</p> <p>But unlike the fleeting and fickle human mind, the ever-flowing ley lines remember all. Surging elemental energy takes on spirit form to recreate all the dreams, both fair and foul, of Wuwang Hill's erstwhile residents. Much like a mother who once lost a child and now searches desperately through their irretrievable past for a way to bring everything back, the ley lines \u2014 albeit unconsciously \u2014 repeatedly recreate the past and those who inhabited it. The way each looked, the way each child cried, the way the elderly would sigh in their twilight years. Each moment of joy, and each moment of sorrow. And like the hypnotic song of the great creature of the deep sea, it unintentionally lures toward it any nostalgic soul who would dare trespass here.</p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Records_of_Jueyun/#vol-4-mountain-spirits","title":"Vol. 4 - Mountain Spirits","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue.

These glowing spirits are unfailingly found hovering in the mountain mist, in the ruins of ancient cities, or in crumbling, decrepit villages. Should a Vision-bearer draw near, the seelie will guide the way for them, leading them to long-hidden treasure or unfathomably ingenious mechanisms.</p> <p>The people of Liyue believe these tiny, silent spirits to be auspicious sightings, the souls either of departed adepti or unnamed benevolent gods of old. Others believe they are the echoes of strangers without kin, lingering in the mountains to guide lonely, lost visitors onto the path back home.</p> <p>Another old legend told in the mountain villages claims that there was once a time, before the adepti had come into being, when the seelie who meander in the mountains knew an altogether different existence, one in which they had beautiful physical forms and possessed great wisdom. That era, when the seelie roamed the mountains and strolled through the grand halls in the cities of old, is said to date back even further that the days when Rex Lapis fought bitterly against countless rival gods.</p> <p>At a far-flung moment in the distant past, the ancestor of the seelie met a traveler from afar, with whom they swore an oath of union witnessed by the three sisters of the Lunar Palace. Just thirty days later, a sudden disaster struck. The seelie and their lover fled into exile as the world collapsed around them, fleeing until the terrible calamity caught up with and seized them. Their cruel punishment was to be separated from each other for eternity and to have their memories wiped without a trace.</p> <p>The graceful but heartbroken seelie and the sisters grew more sullen and withdrawn with each passing day, to the point where their wondrous forms withered away, leaving fragments of their former selves scattered in the mountains and ruins, where they turned into tiny little life forms. They had forgotten so much, lost so much, and been stripped of their voices and wisdom, yet they continued to sing the same songs of grief. Because of this, still harboring a shred of the deep love they once had for their long-lost lover, they will act as guides to travelers who stop in the mountain mist, seeking to retrace their memories of an ancient story in long-abandoned ruins, disused makeup cabinets, and now-undecipherable poetry.</p> <p>Of course, these are nothing but clumsy, incoherent folk tales, wild and fantastical conjecture about what Liyue may have been like in the distant past before the time of Rex Lapis. Needless to say, such tales have no credibility whatsoever.

It is said that qilin will never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a qilin's characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for a thousand years.</p> <p>Following the barbarous age of the Archon War, many adepti became unable to continue living among the clamorous world of mortals.

The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm.</p> <p>To make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly adeptal appearance, she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before the herb gatherer.</p> <p>The young illuminated beast ultimately did not understand human notions of shame and privacy. She stood in that mountain forest, lit by cold moonlight and the glow of fireflies, clothed only in dewdrops and the lunar gleam.

Some people say that one night, the qilin placed a bamboo basket outside the front door of the herb gatherer's home, before disappearing into the moonlit mist. When the herb gatherer came to the door, he found a child soundly asleep inside the basket.</p> <p>Others say that from that moment on the qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew accustomed to human life.</p> <p>No matter the truth of the thousand-year-old matter, the elegant illuminated beasts continue to walk among the residents of Liyue, unseen among the sea of people, waiting for the day when Rex Lapis calls them forth once again.</p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Records_of_Jueyun/#vol-6-hidden-jade","title":"Vol. 6 - Hidden Jade","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue.

Qiangu sought to thank the old man with all manner of courtesies and compensations, but he dismissed them all. After much deliberation, he took just a single Mora to one day give as a wedding gift to Qiangu's beloved daughter, in order that he might attend the wedding feast.</p> <p>Out of disaster seemed to spring forth good fortune, for following this incident Qiangu's store grew ever more popular while word of the wealthy herb seller himself spread far and wide.

If this truly was nothing more than a counterfeit, not only would it imply that she had lost an immense portion of her wealth, but it would also mean irrevocable damage to the reputation of Xigu Antiques as connoisseurs of quality.  </p> <p>Min'gui knew what she had to do: Not only must she somehow get rid of this calamitous customer who threatened to ruin her entire business, but she must also find a way to sell this jade plaque to him in the process.  </p> <p>\"Please, continue,\" she said. \"I would hope that you can give a detailed appraisal.\"  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>\"As we all know, Teyvat was plunged into chaos two and a half millennia ago when the gods declared war on each other, the ensuing conflict spreading to all people in all corners of the land. Teyvat may not have been divided into the same seven nations we know today back in that age, but then, just as now, the people had their own settlements, cities and civilizations...\" \"Gods whose names have now long since been forgotten were once venerated, worshiped, even adored by their people. Our forebears took pearls and shells from the sea, jade from the mountains, rocks from the plains, and salt crystals from the earth, each to build idols in form of their gods. \"Jade plaques of this kind are relics of that era. They belonged to an ancient tribe who worshiped Rex Lapis... though, of course, the Geo Lord probably did not yet go by the name Rex Lapis at that time.\" \"This was an age where people watched their gods clash in bitter battles before their very eyes. Rex Lapis would not establish the currency of the seven nations and cast the first Mora coins for quite some time. So the tribes traded using pieces of ore they would chance across from time to time, with idols made in the likeness of the Geo Lord to ensure price stability.\" \"As you can see... Mortal wisdom is quite a fascinating thing. They were making their own way in the world even before Rex Lapis had made provisions for them to do so.\"  </p> <p>The young man paused as if to further contemplate the observation he had just made. He stood there, cloaked in a veil of silver moonlight, which somehow served to make him every so slightly more diminutive in stature.  </p> <p>\"This type of jade plaque is a rare find in this day and age. Most of them are buried in riverbeds up in the mountains. And since each one is hand carved, they are all unique... That is why they typically sell for astronomical prices. To claim that they are priceless would not be an exaggeration.\" \"So, it is quite a shame indeed that the one you display on your shelf is a recent counterfeit. By recent, I mean that it was probably made in your father's generation at the earliest.\" \"There is an industry saying, 'the jade without blemish is no jade at all.' This jade, for instance, has remarkably few imperfections, and the translucency is too good to be true... All of which points to the fact that it is unlikely to be a product of our forebears' making.\" \"As a side point, I would also add that the image carved onto this jade is that of a woman. This is a highly unusual thing to see among similar relics from the era in question.\"  </p> <p>The young man held the plaque up to the moonlight to inspect it in more detail. \"Although there are plenty of rumors to this effect, the claim that Rex Lapis once took the form of a woman is not attested to by any of the historical records, and there is no physical evidence of it ever occurring...\"  </p> <p>Though young, the man had the air of an old and infuriating pedant about him.  </p> <p>\"Ah, well this is where you're wrong...\" Min'gui smiled faintly, much as a fox does when toying with an inexperienced hunter. \"Perhaps you'd be willing to listen to my story before making your final verdict?\"  </p> <p>The shop owner narrowed her eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Rex_Incognito/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis' incognito excursions in the mortal realm. Between lofty mountain peaks where bounteous jade lies beneath, substantial ideas and empty lies are suddenly shown up side by side.</p> <p>Back in the age when the gods still walked upon the earth, the deity whom we now worship as Rex Lapis was but one among many. In those days, the rumor among the common folk was that the Lord of Geo was a cold and unfeeling god. His conduct was just in all things and his judgments were rational and dispassionate, but he lacked normal human sentiment. Like the rocks, he was without warmth or softness. Despite this, people revered and placed their faith in him all the same. This was because his laws served to guarantee that trade was fair and that life was safe and orderly. The Geo Archon grew in strength and stature because of the people's belief in him.  </p> <p>But even gods are powerless to control the beliefs and doubts of their mortal followers. And even a god who is the guardian of justice has no means of instilling the words of his rules and regulations into the heart of every individual.  </p> <p>In Mingyun Village there was an incorrigibly irreverent jade craftsman who loved to jest. Whatever job he took on, he would complete it in the most unorthodox means imaginable, and would always finish the job on the very last day before it was due.  </p> <p>If the customer ordered a statue of a hunter dominating a ferocious beast, they would receive a miniature statue of a distressed boar running for its life. And when the customer demanded an explanation, he would tell them: \"When a formidable hunter closes in on a fierce beast, he may not show his face, but his imposing presence is enough to frighten the beast to its core.\"  </p> <p>If the customer ordered a carving in the likeness of a powerful and mighty ruler, they would probably receive a statue of a majestic throne. And when asked about it, he would reply: \"No ruler takes the throne for more than one hundred years. The throne has more longevity than he.\"  </p> <p>The craftsman quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric in Mingyun Village. But the wealthy merchants in the prosperous commercial port of Liyue Harbor were most amused and were only too willing to place orders with him \u30fc if only to experience for themselves what it was like to be on the receiving end of this mischievous man's antics.  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>One night, a woman came to his workshop. She was dressed in a long, slender black gown and her eyes shone a brilliant amber in the light of the crescent moon hanging in Liyue's sky that night. The craftsman had never met her before, but he quickly found himself deep in conversation with her. It was strange, she seemed acquainted with every vein of ore and deposit of jade in the village. She talked about the wonders of the world like they were her sisters, and spoke of jade and precious metals with a fondness one would normally reserve for their beloved daughter... The only topics she brushed over were culture, customs, and social interactions. Perhaps she was not wise to the ways of the world, or perhaps she did not wish to discuss them. Regardless, there was certainly something out of the ordinary about this woman. At least, the craftsman thought so.  </p> <p>\"I would like for you to make me a jade plaque bearing the likeness of the Lord of Geo on its surface.\" The woman finally stated her request once their broad-reaching and lengthy conversation had reached its end, and she was all but ready to leave. \"But I have one condition: You may not conjure up our Lord's likeness from your imagination. You must carve the true likeness of our Lord relying on what you have seen with your own two eyes.\" \"Otherwise,\" she said, \"I'm not paying a single Mora.\"  </p> <p>And so a deal was struck between the two, with an agreed turnaround of three days.  </p> <p>On the first day, the craftsman dined and drank with his good friends. He did not take a single new job on that day.  </p> <p>On the second day, the craftsman climbed a mountain to view the jade there, not seeing a single customer or acquaintance for the entire day.  </p> <p>Only on the third day did the craftsman close the doors of his workshop and begin carving away at the uncut jade, working from dawn to dusk, until finally it was complete.  </p> <p>When the crescent moon once again began to ruse in the Liyue night sky, the amber-eyed woman returned and approached his doorstep. The craftsman proudly handed over the fruits of his labor: A jade plaque bearing the likeness of their god, in female form.  </p> <p>The woman was puzzled. She frowned, and demanded an explanation. And this was the explanation that he gave: \"On the first day, I sought counsel from every wise and learned person that I know, and learned the principles of our Lord and how they work. But this was just the skeleton.\" \"On the second day, I visited the mountains and spent a whole day observing the mountain rocks, listening to the ebb and flow of the elements, and pondering all that our Lord had created. But this was just the flesh.\" \"On the third day, I covered both my eyes and began to carve from the heart, starting when it felt like the time to start, stopping when it felt like the time to stop. At last, this was the spirit.\"  </p> <p>The craftsman smiled awkwardly, then added: \"But even I'm not sure why it came out like this.\"  </p> <p>The woman tilted the item back and forth in her hand, as if contemplating something. \"Interesting,\" she finally responded. \"Incidentally, this reminds me of another story...\"  </p> <p>She looked up at him with her amber-colored eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Liyue/Rex_Incognito/#vol-3","title":"Vol. 3","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis' incognito excursions in the mortal realm.

At the height of Liyue Harbor's prosperity, a myriad goods and treasures flowed endless in and out of the land like the rising and falling tides. That age belonged, as does the current one, to the wealthy merchants and ship owners. It was an age in which the ones who reigned supreme were those who dared wrestle with the tumultuous tides of the market and the wrathful beasts of the ocean.  </p> <p>Likewise, then as now, the port was constantly abuzz with sailors and laborers. Legend has it that Rex Lapis, when appearing in mortal form, does not always take the form of a distinguished gentleman fraternizing with the well-to-do of Yujing Terrace. Sometimes, it is said, he takes the form of a commoner and mingles with the miners, the fishermen, the sailors, and the peddlers.  </p> <p>Back in that day, there was a certain fishing vessel owner who was notoriously harsh and critical in his temperament.

He had just been hired by the fishing vessel owner, and his attire was indistinguishable from that of any other seafarer of the day: a loose-fitting brown shirt and trousers, and a bandana around his forehead. But from his tanned skin and the rugged, karst-like contours of his facial features, it was clear that he was a commoner from Qingce Village who had come down from the mountains into the city in an attempt to reverse his fortunes.  </p> <p>Like most mountain-dwellers of his day, he was a simple-minded and unsophisticated fellow. But what dismayed his new boss more than this was his reluctance to go anywhere near the catches of the slimy and tentacled variety.  </p> <p>\"You don't make money by being choosy! Who do you think you are, lord of the manor?\" This was the only justification the ship owner gave for docking the newly hired mountain's man pay.  </p> <p>The youngster simply smiled bashfully and continued with his work. This set the tone for many of the interactions between the two. But one day, the youngster responded instead with a question: \"Everyone has likes and dislikes, so why should we do the things we hate the most?\"  </p> <p>The fishing vessel owner was taken completely by surprise by this random question. Incensed, he slapped his simpleton apprentice on the head and barked back at him: \"Them's the rules of the world, you moron! Listen good: You'll get yourself nowhere in this world if you won't do a job you don't like!\"  </p> <p>\"But maybe that wasn't what Rex Lapis meant when he made the rules...\"  </p> <p>\"Shut up, you idiot!\"  </p> <p>\"Hmm, maybe you'll understand better if I tell you a story.\" The young man's eyes shone like amber from the mountain mines in the light of the setting sun.  </p> <p>\"Oh? So you're a storyteller now, are you?\" At the thought of this simpleton from a sleepy mountain village telling him a story, the fishing vessel owner found himself suddenly quite curious. \"Go on then... But I expect you to work and talk at the same time!\"  </p> <p>A mischievous smile flickered across the youngster's face, and a twinkle flashed in his eye. \"Well then, let me tell you a story about a certain jade plaque...\"  </p> <p>And so, the young man proceeded to tell his tale.

This night, Min'gui, mistress of Xigu Antiques, was researching relics and narrating ancient stories with an unnamed son of nobility.

It contains various fragmented historical events.</p> <p>In the beginning, Rex Lapis descended. He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng, and calmed the waves. Thereupon, peace was brought to the people. They cut into the mountain and found jade, they bored through the rock and made tunnels, and they piled up stones and built a settlement. It is written that the jade from the bowels of the mountain is that which glows. Hence, they named it \"Shanhui Fort\"[1]. In that time, all the people of Tianheng derived their livelihood from the mines, all prospered from them, and none knew poverty within a thousand-mile radius.  </p> <p>[1] Better known today as \"Shanhui Rock,\" which is often simplified to \"Mountain Rock,\" thereby stripping the name of most of its original meaning.  </p> <p>...  </p> <p>Guizhong, the Lord of Dust, was an ally to the Lord of Rock. Around Mt. Tianheng, Guizhong set up a Crossbow to keep guard, and it was named the \"Guizhong Ballista.\" She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles, and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the fields. Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: \"My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call this place than 'the Plains of the Returning and Departing?'\" The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work, and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue \"Guili Plains.\"  </p> <p>[2] It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness.  </p> <p>...  </p> <p>Rex Lapis pacified the gods, adepti and yakshas were content in their positions, and Liyue re-entered an era of peace. Before this time, the gods waged war for centuries on end, and not one field was left unravaged. The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing the monsters at the border.

Its captain was a man who tracked and hunted terrible monsters of the deep, known as the \"Skipper.\" The ships hull was adorned with skeletons of monsters from the sea, an unmistakable signal of their the Skipper's fearless will. However, the shanties of the crew seldom made any mention of hunting creatures of the deep. It's not that the sailors didn't revel in their reputation and brag of their achievements, but ages of navigating the merciless seas had taught them that ballads of blood and water were the most unlucky of all.  </p> <p>With his sword in hand, the Skipper sailed across the watery expanse, coasting along rocky reefs and cruising with surging undercurrents. He fearlessly guided his ship to face the roar of squalls and sea monsters alike. The dark worlds that laid beneath murky waters were like boundless hunting grounds. Any monster that would dare stir the tranquil waters often became the next trophy hanging from the side of the ship.  </p> <p>But the Skipper only knew wind and waves, and never seemed to grasp the bittersweet lives of ordinary people. For he occupied all his days with searching and hunting, accompanied solely by the salty sea breeze and the muffled calls of whales in the deep. The crew feared him more than they adored him, ever cautious of his character, relentless as if trying to break free from tangles of seaweed. The Skipper's clipper silently sailed forward, unyielding to the perilous stretches of sea.  </p> <p>Only the young maiden who always sat atop the towering bow could ever reveal a glimmer of softness to the Skipper's eyes. She was his navigator, charmed by the tidal song and humming with the whales, guiding the ship through the wind and waves to waters infested by beasts.  </p> <p>A young maiden at the helm offered her songs to the sea, paying due respect to its every billow and breeze...  </p> <p>\"Hark the calls of creatures deep, and echoes of waves tossed in the gale.

Flashes of lightning revealed the Skipper's silhouette, fearlessly grasping his sword.  </p> <p>Following the Skipper's fixed gaze, the crew could only make out an alpine shape shadowed by tenebrous clouds. The massive figure that lay skulking in the distance was the body of the beast. The once fearsome skeletons that hung from the ship now seemed like mere cubs compared with the terrifying silhouette that lay sprawling before them like a mountain range in the center of the maelstrom.  </p> <p>At the Skipper's bellowing command, the crew fired broadside after broadside of giant crossbows, unleashing their mortal fears and delusions on the massive body that lay like a towering wall before them.

The sailors were drenched in the foul torrents as they cursed the gods of the elements and continued to rake the body of the beast with stones and sharpened spears.  </p> <p>The ruthless Skipper never flinched at the opponents dealt to him by fate. The thundering roars of the terrible beast were answered by songs of the young maiden atop the bow. The ship maneuvered round the monster, cruising upon the spinning torrents, and answering sharp fangs and swiping stingers with catapults, harpoons, slings, and even mortal bodies to vent their dread and fury.  </p> <p>Once the monster's body was riddled with wounds and nearly all its tentacles and claws had been severed, the Skipper's ship too had been reduced to a floating hulk. Half of the ship's masts had fallen, half of its guns were out of action, and half the crew had been taken as dinner for the monster \u2014 even the Skipper's prized sword had been cleaved in two.

Due to the archaic nature of the author's writing style, it was largely dismissed by the public and publishers alike. \"Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti\" introduces the readers to the various yakshas who fought side-by-side with the Geo Archon.</p> <p>Liyue knew naught but plague in antiquity. The warmongering gods made it so, for the vanquished were crushed under the rocks, and there they rotted and became soil. Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements, which doth span both Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. But some souls held on to their hatred and took on flesh once more as daemons. The daemons rose up in anger, giving rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore, it is said: The daemonic is the shadow of the divine.</p> <p>\"Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless warring between gods. The defeated were squashed beneath the rocks of the earth, where they decomposed and became soil, and finally re-entered the everlasting elemental cycle. Some of the gods' souls were filled with bitterness at their fate, and refused to suffer it any longer. Their bitterness materialized and became evil monsters. The monsters' rage manifested itself in the form of diseases, monster infestations, and all kinds of other strange occurrences. The monsters ravaged the land and turned it into a wilderness, and unleashed all manner of evil upon the rivers and seas. They inflicted untold suffering on the people. Hence, what we call monsters are in fact physical manifestations of the resentment of gods defeated in war.\"</p> <p>Rex Lapis summoned yakshas unto him to purge the daemons. Illuminated beasts of dreadful appearance and warlike temperament were they, and no brutality did they spare in their duty to defend. Of the many, five were the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. Wherever battle took Rex Lapis, so too did they follow, until the plague was purged. The five are known unto mortals as \"The Yakshas.\"</p> <p>\"Rex Lapis summoned yakshas to help him destroy the monsters. The yakshas were illuminated beasts of Liyue. Ferocious and intimidating to behold, they were violent by nature and formidable in battle, ready to kill mercilessly to defend Rex Lapis' rule. Among the yakshas, five were known as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. The five followed Rex Lapis into battle countless times, finally wiping out the evil at its source. They became known throughout the world simply as 'The Yakshas'.\"</p> <p>\"The Yakshas\" were guardians of Rex Lapis for years without measure, and the evils they vanquished were incalculable. Yet, mighty though they were, beyond the torment that betide all who face war the yakshas were not, and they became afflicted. Some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul. After a millennium did fate present itself unto them, and it was such: three of the five perished, the fourth vanished, and all of the myriad shared the fate of the three or the fourth. The fifth alone prevailed, and the fifth was Alatus.</p> <p>\"'The Yakshas' faithfully protected Rex Lapis and pacified all manner of catastrophes in the world. This continued for many years. But there came a day when the yakshas, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll, and that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that cannot be put into words, or were driven by fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on and destroyed each other. Some were lost to delusions of the mind. After a thousand years' scourges, three of the five were slain, and one disappeared. Many other yakshas of unknown name also either died or fled. In the end, only one of the five, Alatus, survived.\"</p> <p>Alatus is the Golden-Winged King who is also the Conqueror of Demons. None knows whence he came, nor whither he went. Only at springtime, during the offering of lanterns at night, might the people see the glow at Guyun and declare: \"Behold, the Vigilant Yaksha ends the dominion of daemons!\" Or they might hear the sound of a flute amongst the marsh reeds, but find none who play the flute, and thus declare: \"Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.\"</p> <p>\"Alatus is also known as the Golden-Winged King, or alternatively as the Conqueror of Demons. Nobody knows where he came from, and nobody knows where he went. In spring of each year, when the Lantern Rite festival arrives, Liyue people will gaze at the glow in the air above Guyun Stone Forest, and say: 'Behold, the Guardian Yaksha ends the dominion of demons.' Some hear a sound like a flute coming from Dihua Marsh, but when they enter the marsh there is no flutist to be found. They say: 'Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.'\"</p> <p>Thus, divine endowment doth carry with it that ultimate and unbreakable trial: to lose kin, friend, or ally, to face the impossibility of redemption, to burn in everlasting anger and know no respite. To become the foe of an ancient evil was to abandon hope of both reward and resolution in his endeavors, and his torment was that of the preta, which is to be without satiety after ten thousand fates.</p> <p>\"For this reason, it is said that the wages of being blessed with supernatural power is a destiny of hardship and eventual destruction. For the yaksha lost all his friends, family, and those he fought alongside. He built up an incalculable karmic debt from the violent deeds his life necessitated, and the consequence was a heart filled with darkness and hatred from which there was no rest. There was no reward to be gained from making an enemy of his own bitterness and hatred from the old days, nor was there any escape from the unbearable suffering. The torment ate away at his heart like an insatiable wolf, and an infinite number of lifetimes could have done nothing to reduce it.\"</p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/1000_Years_of_Loneliness/","title":"1000 Years of Loneliness","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The beginning of the Springvale Hunter's tragic fantasy journey.

This one is the story of a drunkard who stumbled into wolven territory and the lone, starving wolf he encountered there.</p> <p>In the land where the dandelion wine flows like a river, tall tales have a way of spreading far and wide, following closely in the wake of the whiff of wine. Far-fetched fables are always sure to spread when boasted between burps by inebriated bar patrons. For these stories share something in common with the slurred speech and sea-sickness-inducing swaying that so often accompanies them, which is that despite being clumsy and awkward, they are also highly entertaining.  </p> <p>Legend has it that there was once a famous drunkard in Mondstadt. It was said that he could hold his alcohol as well as any hunter from Springvale in the off season. And yet, still he would drink till he was drunk, every time that he drank, he would not budge so much as an inch back from the bar at the tavern until not a single Mora was left in his coin pouch, and not a single drop of wine remained in his glass.  </p> <p>One night, this drunkard was doing his best to stumble home after a particularly satisfying session of especially heavy drinking. A combination of his spinning head, blurred vision, and zigzagging stride served to navigate him towards a forest populated by wolves.  </p> <p>Today, of course, Wolvendom is presided over by the Great Wolf King of the North, and the ominous atmosphere that emanates from inside the forest is sufficient to deter most sober-headed visitors from approaching the area. According to the elderly hunters, the Wolf King gathered the spirits of the wolves there to prevent outsiders from trespassing into territory where they are not welcome. But this was an age long before the Wolf King and the north wind had descended upon that forest, bringing order and peace to the wolven race. At that time, the forest was a perilous place where wild wolves fought for survival. A fierce blood feud between wolves played out deep inside the dense foliage, concealed from view and unbeknownst to any man.  </p> <p>Least of all to the drunkard, who had by this point managed to transport his drunken self quite some distance inside the forest.  </p> <p>He stumbled forward in the darkness with that dogged determination that only drunkards possess, deterred neither by the tree roots that would trip him up every few steps, nor by the stray branches that would slyly slap him in the face from time to time. Before long, a pair of green eyes began darting through the forest, their gaze fixed on him, tracking his every move. Those eyes belonged to a lone wolf, who silently pursued the drunkard from behind, all the while musing to itself: \"This is the most peculiar sight I have ever seen in all my life.\"  </p> <p>No one had dared set foot in the wolves' forest in hundreds of years, be they a knight clad top to toe in shining steel armor or a desperate fugitive dressed in rags. Even the callous nobles refused to exile their slaves there, for fear of inciting the wrath of the wild wolves and bringing unwanted trouble to their own territory.  </p> <p>\"And yet, this odd fellow dares to stroll in here all by himself. How very strange indeed!\" The lone wolf pondered this strange phenomenon as it followed the drunken intruder through the forest, doing its best to ignore the stench of alcohol that was wafting its way.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/A_Drunkards_Tale/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>One of many Mondstadt tales told of popular drinkers. This story is the one of the time a lone, starving wolf met a drunken Mondstadt man.</p> <p>It is a well-known fact that wolves have a far keener sense of smell than humans. Another way of putting this is that their noses are much more sensitive. Little wonder, then, that the stench of alcohol emanating from the wolf's now historically intoxicated prey was quite stifling, and caused tears to well up in its eyes.  </p> <p>\"Awoo...\" the wolf thought to itself. Having been born in the wilderness and grown up in the forest, the wolf had never had any contact with human civilization before this night, and though it had once caught the faint scent of wine wafting across Cider Lake, it did not know the scent's origin, less still understand the significance of that substance to human kind.  </p> <p>\"Perhaps this peculiar fellow is a relative of the skunk, for it seems that he discovered my presence quite some time ago, and now means to poison me in an effort to secure his escape!\" The wolf pondered this possibility as it braced itself against the onslaught of alcoholic fumes, picked up its pace, and discreetly maneuvered its way into the drunkard's shadow \u2014 the perfect vantage point from which to inspect its prey.  </p> <p>The wolf is a creature of caution and calculation. The drunkard, meanwhile, is a different sort of creature entirely. And yet, though wine tends to dizzy the mind and dull the senses, it sometimes affords its consumers the curious capacity to detect the subtlest of changes in the direction of the wind. Perhaps this could explain how a bumbling drunkard, fumbling through the forest, was suddenly able to discover the presence of a wolf that had been stealthily following him the entire time. Or perhaps the alcoholic fumes given off by the drunkard were sufficiently potent to diminish the wolf's mental acuity, to the point that the wolf became less mindful of the terrain beneath its paws, the resulting sound of snapping twigs thus alerting the prey to the predator's presence.  </p> <p>\"Who's that? Don't s'pose you know which way the toilet is, by any chance...?\" The bumbling drunkard rubbed his bleary eyes. \"Foul-smelling human,\" snarled the wolf, \"Who are you, and whence proceeds your stench?\" The wolf flared its nostrils, bored its fangs, and growled.  </p> <p>Not only was the drunkard unafraid when he heard the wolf's gruffly voiced threat, but he even became quite animated. \"My friend!\" the drunkard replied, \"Clearly I've offended you, somehow... sorry 'bout that... but anyway, Mondstadt tradition says you're not allowed to be drunk and bored at the same time... So! Here we are, out in the woods on this glorious moonlit night... How abouts I tell you a story?\" His proposal was promptly punctuated by an almighty belch.  </p> <p>Before this point, the wolf had had no intention of listening to the belching buffoon's drunken ramblings. In fact, it was poised to deliver a fatal blow to its prey by lunging for the neck, sinking its fangs in, and tearing his throat clean out. But the drunkard's belch blasted a further bout of fumes in the wolf's direction, assailing its nostrils with such force that it ruined the wolf's appetite entirely. Grudgingly, the wolf agreed. \"Grr... Perhaps I'm not so hungry after all... Let's see what nonsense tale you have to tell.\"  </p> <p>The drunkard stretched out his arms and let out a loud yawn, disturbing a few dandelions in the process.

This drunkard is the one who told the lone wolf of an ancient story.</p> <p>Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away.  </p> <p>Once, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body.  </p> <p>He has led the way as they ran across open plains, navigated through abandoned ruins, and passed through the domains of monsters and the Seelie. The wasteland was a cruel place. The wolf-king grew older with each passing day, and the other wolves gradually dispersed. As time went by, the wolf pack's history faded into distant memory, until finally only the aged wolf-king remained, the sole survivor of its pack.  </p> <p>This wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of the deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty. So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention.  </p> <p>\"Never before have I heard a sound so pleasing to the ears, whether it be a song of bird or insect, that it stays the pangs of hunger in my starved stomach as this tune does.\" Intrigued, the wolf stepped inside the gray hall, trod across the overgrown weeds, and passed by a broken sarcophagus, on which a portrait of the deceased ruler was still clearly visible.  </p> <p>Finally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument. Her skin was ashen white and her head was bowed down, her slender fingers gently stroking the fragile strings of the lute as she played a long-forgotten and mournful melody.  </p> <p>The wolf sat down in front of the pale young maiden and forgot all about the pain of hunger, thirst, and loneliness for a short while, as it listened in silence to her song.  </p> <p>\"The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight...\" \"Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, song and memories are all that now remain of yesteryear.\" \"The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the halls of angels.\"  </p> <p>The tiny Seelie playing in the forest were also drawn to the young maiden's tune, and flocked to her to pay their respects.  </p> <p>\"What is this song that you play?\" The wolf asked, puzzled, for it understood every line, every word, every syllable she spoke \u2014 and yet, hers was a language that it had never heard before, quite unlike that of any other living being.  </p> <p>\"A song of the Seelie,\" Replied the pale young maiden in a soft voice. \"Long, long ago, we wrote this song for the human savages. Yet now, we sing it to mourn our own fate.\"  </p> <p>The wolf began to sing along, albeit clumsily, to the maiden's tune. The wolf's voice was husky and broken, filled with a lifetime of sorrow.  </p> <p>\"What are you singing?\" The maiden asked of the wolf.  </p> <p>\"This is our song,\" Responded the wolf.  </p> <p>\"It sounds ghastly.\" The maiden made no attempt to soften her criticism as she continued to caress the lute strings. \"But, you are welcome to sing along with me all the same.\"  </p> <p>And so, a shared chorus sung by fair young maiden and weary old wolf filled the chambers of the long-abandoned palace. It is said that to this day, adventurers who pass by this place still hear a strange yet harmonious melody sounding from within.  </p> <p>\"And then? ...The story ends here?\" The wolf licked its lips, somewhat ruefully, and then said: \"I suppose I shall tell you a story now.\"  </p> <p>And with that, the wolf cleared its throat and began to tell its tale.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/A_Drunkards_Tale/#vol-4","title":"Vol. 4","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>One of many drinking tales popularly told in Mondstadt. This wolf told a tale of wine and wolf to a drunken man of Mondstadt.</p> <p>Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled.  </p> <p>In the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion, Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.  </p> <p>It is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.  </p> <p>In a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders. The sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment \u2014 but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered \u2014 or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering \u2014 to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.  </p> <p>At that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards.  </p> <p>One day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment. The grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.  </p> <p>The grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.  </p> <p>In his first drunken dream, he drunkenly dreamt that he had become a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first seelie.  </p> <p>The tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams.  </p> <p>But their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.  </p> <p>The human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them. What concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.  </p> <p>So the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine. Wolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.  </p> <p>\"What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,\" The wolf haughtily concluded. But as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.  </p> <p>The wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.</p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Along_with_Divinity_Prologue/","title":"Along with Divinity: Prologue","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>\"Have you ever thought about what our lives would've been like without the archons?\" Come and join the author in an exploration of \"divinity\" with humor and logic.</p> <p>When our perceptions are unfettered by archons and churches, we shall learn that in northern Teyvat, the people of Mondstadt preserved their culture as decades ago, even after Barbatos the Anemo Archon concealed himself. When we observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a carefree nature, which mostly stems from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their easygoing temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon never taught them how to make wine and revel \u2014 they discovered it themselves. But I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the brews that it does? The answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed everything. A cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers will keep one thing in mind when reading my humble book: while it is the power of archons that created our living environment, we should be conscious of the fact that what shapes our thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the archons themselves, but the objective environment that exists around us. This world around us is what we have inherited, and what this book shows is that the people of Teyvat have always been, and always will be, heirs to a divine legacy \u2014 but not to divinity itself.</p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Ancient_Investigation_Journal/","title":"Ancient Investigation Journal","text":"<p>Author: Luther</p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Ancient_Investigation_Journal/#part-1","title":"Part 1","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>An investigation journal found in front of the ruins with a circular entrance.

It consists of fragmented stories and legends from the aristocratic period.</p> <p>May the gentle breeze of Barbatos carry words of enlightenment and deliver them into the gaze of my readers. And may the wind of freedom forever prevail in Mondstadt.  </p> <p>The story of the Gunnhildr Clan begins in legend, three thousand years ago during the war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius. It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and Gunnhildr was about to become the strongest leader her nomadic clan had ever seen.  </p> <p>Gunnhildr's father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he had led his clan outside of the city where ferocious winds howled without mercy. But life in the wasteland beyond the city gates was harsh and unforgiving. Though they had escaped the wrath of a tyrant, they were now faced with the wrath of relentless and all-engulfing blizzards.  </p> <p>Just when all hope seemed to be lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard Gunnhildr's prayers. The sincere plea of a clan chief's young daughter joined with a people's cry of help, a cry that the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief's daughter the power to protect.  </p> <p>After her father's death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan's leader. She also became its first priestess. From that day forth, she protected her clan faithfully. When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king Decarabian's rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon's fury. But when Barbatos finally fought through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant's subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo Archon with laurels.  </p> <p>In later times, after Barbatos had departed, a class of aristocrats emerged across the land. These rulers, who were possessed of divine power, would become corrupted and turn to tyranny themselves a thousand years later, but none had the ability to predict the distant future. Not even Barbatos himself.  </p> <p>Gunnhildr's descendants were themselves a prominent clan within the Aristocracy. But unlike the evil and scheming Lawrence Clan, the Gunnhildrs upheld their legacy of protecting Mondstadt that was always enshrined in their motto, \"for Mondstadt, as always,\" doing everything within their power to protect its people. During the later struggle to overthrow the Aristocracy, they took the side of the people of Mondstadt. For this reason, they were spared the sentence of exile that was imposed on the rest of the Aristocracy.  </p> <p>Today, the Gunnhildr Clan is a source of many brave knights and outstanding clergy members that serve in the Knights of Favonius. If history can teach us anything at all about the future, perhaps it is that the Gunnhildr Clan will continue honoring the legacy of its ancestors and its duty to the Anemo Archon: to protect Mondstadt, the land and all who inhabit it, forever.</p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Breeze_Amidst_the_Forest/","title":"Breeze Amidst the Forest","text":""},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Breeze_Amidst_the_Forest/#vol-1","title":"Vol. 1","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A collection of Mondstadt ballads, recorded, compiled, and arranged by scholars centuries ago.</p> <p>\u2014Ballad Selection Excerpt\u2014  </p> <p>\"Breeze Amidst the Forest\" and \"Breeze Upon the Lake\" constitute a two-volume collection of narrative poems.

He slowly descended, and inspected everything with curious eyes.  </p> <p>He landed in a village, only for the terrified villagers to throw rocks at him. The dragon could not understand why they cried in fear. He landed in a cemetery, only to hear the lament of grieving people. The dragon could not understand what they murmured in sorrow. He landed in an orchard, only to be cursed by the furious farmers who lost their trees. The dragon could not understand why they screamed in anger.  </p> <p>The world was too complicated for a young dragon. The dragon was bewildered, yet he did not give up.  </p> <p>One day, the dragon heard music pouring out from the Holy Lyre der Himmel. This was the name of the lyre belonging to the Anemo Archon. Enchanted by the poetry, the Wind Dragon landed beside the best singer under the skies.  </p> <p>People panicked, for the mighty elemental dragons and the great archons that reigned over the earth had never seen eye to eye.  </p> <p>\"Behold his beauty and benignity!\" The Windborne Bard sang.  </p> <p>\"But we do not know him,\" the people replied.  </p> <p>What mysterious magic lies behind music and poetry that has the power to mesmerize both dragons and humans alike?

The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition, and created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers. Durin, a black serpentine dragon, rose from the sea to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. But it was at this very moment that there was no one to inherit the title of Lionfang Knight, thus, the Knights of Favonius could not fly their falcon flag.  </p> <p>The persistent yet despondent prayers called upon the archon of Mondstadt, the Windborne Bard. The strings of the lyre were strummed once more, and the Wind Dragon was summoned forth.  </p> <p>As Mondstadt's last line of defense, the Wind Dragon battled the wicked dragon to the death in raging storms.  </p> <p>The Wind Dragon prevailed. He tore open the throat of the wicked dragon, at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood. The blood of the wicked dragon was distorted gold, with the powers to crumble mountains and poison the earth.  </p> <p>The Wind Dragon protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. And so, he drifted off into a deep slumber.  </p> <p>The Holy Lyre played a sorrowful tune.  </p> <p>The Holy Lyre sang: should you awaken, spread your wings and live your life freely! A dragon is born to soar the skies, and mortals shall surely grasp your beauty...  </p> <p>(*Typically, when life arises from the elements, it either descends and becomes a slime, or ascends and becomes a crystalfly.

During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian\" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor.

This volume features the social structure and characteristics of the hilichurls.</p> <p>Hilichurlian Social Structure  </p> <p>The social structure of the hilichurl race is evidently a primitive, tribal one. Small-sized hilichurl tribes are prolific in occurrence throughout the wilderness. It seems that they conceive of the tribe as akin to a large, extended family.  </p> <p>By far the most powerful figure in the hilichurl tribe is the Shaman. Extensive field research confirms that the Shaman is the oldest member of the tribe and plays a role in it analogous to that of the parent in the family: managing major affairs and making policy decisions, based on their wealth of experience. Additionally, Shamans act as protector to their tribe using their elemental abilities. Shamans can be identified by their distinctive appearance from other tribe members: They wear horned, smiling-face masks with eye holes at the mouth, and wield a rudimentary Shaman's staff in their hands. A further identifying feature is that they will be heard chanting to themselves some form of unintelligible hymn or incantation.  </p> <p>Age is not always the deciding factor when it comes to status in the tribe. In some tribes, Shamans are ousted from leadership by physically larger Hilichurls with superior combat skills. Under leadership of this kind, such tribes tend to become more aggressive. The chiefs of these tribes can easily be identified from their large stature and ostentatious masks, which also bear horns.  </p> <p>The hilichurls' hostility towards outsiders, coupled with the obvious language barriers, means that conducting specific research on the distribution of resources within tribes has been all but impossible. Nevertheless, Knights of Favonius' patrol reports suggest that resources are typically shared on the basis of \"to each according to his needs\". All tribe members are both gatherers and soldiers, but some that prize combat above others develop into seasoned heavyweights of the battlefield. If the tribe stays long enough in an unfavorable environment, these heavyweights will become its most respected leaders.  </p> <p>Interestingly, hilichurls seem to have a unique ability to manipulate the elements despite their low intelligence and primitive social structure. The ability is most notably manifested in the Shamans. Typically, humans require a Vision in order to exercise elemental control. The question of how Hilichurls are able to do so without a Vision is, therefore, one that requires further investigation and analysis.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Hilichurl_Cultural_Customs/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>It contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian,\" Jacob Musk, a Mondstadt ecologist. This volume explores the diverse cultural customs of the hilichurls in relation to Mondstadt's.</p> <p>Hilichurl Spirituality  </p> <p>Just as the inhabitants of the Seven Nations of Teyvat each have their religious beliefs, so too do the hilichurls. However, they worship not a specific figurehead with a presence in this world \u2014 such as one of The Seven \u2014 but elemental power itself in a more abstract sense. For instance, some hilichurl tribes in Mondstadt revere Anemo just as their human counterparts do, but they do not recognize the Anemo Archon Barbatos. Instead, they worship the power of Anemo itself. Hilichurls holding different elemental beliefs often live together in the same tribe. An individual hilichurl's elemental affiliation can be deduced from the designs on their masks and the color of their body paint.  </p> <p>Firsthand observations indicate that the Shaman, responsible for organizing offerings and worship ceremonies for the tribe, applies a colored dye to their hair and skin, with the color representing the element they worship. Shamans are dressed and adorned more ornately than ordinary tribe members, but owing to the limited intelligence of the hilichurls it is highly doubtful that any of the fine ornaments worn are crafted by their own hand.  </p> <p>The Shaman is the spiritual leader of his tribe. He leads them in song and dance during worship, singing hymns of praise to the elements. If there is leftover meat from the hunt, the hilichurls place it on the altar, raw, as sacrifice. Even though they accumulate ample Mora, precious stones, and other items of value through exploring, looting, mugging, and other means, it would appear that raw meat alone is considered a sufficient sacrifice.  </p> <p>It would appear that the hilichurl possess no concept of either the past or future, living only in the present. They do not intentionally store up food for survival, nor do they commemorate their deceased forebears. Though crude attempts at something like calligraphy have been widely observed within their camps, closer inspection reveals these markings to be nothing more than botched imitations of what they have seen in ancient ruins, possessing no originality whatsoever. Hilichurls do seem to have an inexplicable affinity for remnants of the past, evidenced by the fact that ruins are one of their preferred locations to camp. But investigations thus far have turned up nothing which might hint at the true nature of their connection with the lost civilizations to which these ruins belong.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/Hilichurl_Cultural_Customs/#vol-3","title":"Vol. 3","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>It contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian,\" Jacob Musk, a Mondstadt ecologist.

They have built themselves an environment especially conducive to sleep, consisting of simple, wooden huts furnished with soft animal hide for beds. They are the most cunning and devious of the hilichurl tribes, and their above-average mental capacity can perhaps be attributed to the superior sleep quality they enjoy.  </p> <p>The practices of the Eclipse tribe are the most occult of any in Mondstadt.

Distinct from the elemental powers worshipped by their peers, the object of their worship is a crude symbol that appears to represent an eclipsed sun.

Did they fly to a better place, carrying my hopes and dreams there with them?  </p> <p>When did this happen? Some time ago, behind the village, there grew a forest of countless lush trees. At the center of this forest was a small lake. The lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. The sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something. The weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago. I couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. I became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten entirely that I was out for a hunt. I came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice. Poor critter. \"It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking.\" Mist Flowers are dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them. As it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered in pain. \"Oh no, this won't do.\" I thought to myself. \"Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, may as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day.\" I imagined what a delicious fox stew I could cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking about it gave me energy and brought a smile to my face.

When I went fox hunting, I always chanted his words silently, so that my hands wouldn't shake when pulling the bowstring. But just as I was about to release the arrow, the fox lifted its head and looked me straight in the eye. It had eyes like the lake, glistening as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. My head began spinning, as if a strong wind were blowing inside it. My arrow missed its target and instead smashed the ice, releasing the fox's tail. The fox raised its tail and looked at me once more before running off into the forest. I came to my senses and began the chase \u2014 but who in this world can run faster than a fox? Gradually, the fox began to shrink into the distance, eventually turning into a white spot. \"Hey! Don't go!\" I shouted, barely catching my breath. After hearing my words, the spot seemed to slow. \"Is it waiting for me?\" I pondered. \"If running for its life, a fox is able to shake off anyone in no time.\" Foxes are strange animals. Even when running on a flat plain like at Windrise, where one can see clearly for miles ahead, they somehow still seem to disappear from view. It's almost as if they run into another world. This led me to my conclusion: \"The fox must be waiting for me!\" Convinced of this fact, I chased the glittering white spot for hours on end. Suddenly, a chilling wind began to blow. I stood there, shivering, and what I saw next astounded me. \"How can this be?\" Suddenly, instead of one, there were now two white spots. More appeared. Three, four, five... They seemed to grow in number as the winds blew. Eventually I lost track. Suddenly, with a stinging sensation, one of them flew directly into my eye. Upon inspection, I discovered that the spots were in fact nothing more than dandelion seeds floating in the wind. The fox had disappeared. I laughed at my own foolishness and went home. For supper, I had carrot fox stew \u2014 though without fox, or any other meat for that matter. The gods know how much I hate boiled carrots without meat! I felt starving, and in time fell asleep.

To my surprise, there stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way sunlight sparkles on water after filtering through the treetops. \"This must be the same fox from earlier!\" I thought again of those eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart. And so I walked over to the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes. This time it stayed still and waited for me in silence. The closer I drew, the greater in stature it became. By the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human. She was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water \u2014 in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops. \"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\" I thought to myself. \"This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic.\" Stranger still, the idea of \"fox magic\" had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes. For all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the dead of night. And at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow understand her. Some other magic, perhaps. \"I would have died by that lake, if you had not come in my hour of need.\" She paused and continued: \"Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing,\" \"We foxes are grateful beings, so you must let me return the favor.\" She bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/The_Fox_in_the_Dandelion_Sea/#vol-4","title":"Vol. 4","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>After a few days apart, a long-awaited reunion takes place on a midsummer's night amidst a veritable blizzard of dandelion seeds.

When would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake. Lying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door. I hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me. But there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air. Suddenly, something got caught in my nostrils. \"Ah-Ahchooo!!!\" Immediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm. Amidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart. Waving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox. The fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest. I hurried and followed closely behind. In amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows. Their silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie. With unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land. There, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see. Stunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me. It was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground. The fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers. Two hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders. She leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder. Behind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease. \"Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions. It is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language... In return, I will teach you the magic of foxes.\" There was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air. Strange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known? Without answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions. The night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories... In those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the moon rose high into the starry sky.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/The_Fox_in_the_Dandelion_Sea/#vol-5","title":"Vol. 5","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Upon accepting the Fox's conditions, he came to the place where all the prey who disappeared had eventually gone to \u2014 an endless field of dandelions.

When we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago. And so, when she was around me, it was as if I were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was somehow tinged with sadness. But the thought of her promise \u2014 if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue... \"I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes.\" Remembering the way she made that solemn promise to me... I knew she was serious, and that gave me determination. Could I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef. \"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\" I lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea, where everything sways gently with the wind. One reason was that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives.

As I was thought to myself, the dandelion seed in my hand began to float up towards the moonlight, almost as if it had heard my thoughts. \"I see...\" She lowered her head slightly and her long, black hair flowed down her neck like a waterfall, glistening in the moonlight. Her pale white skin shone brightly, seemingly reflecting the wisps of clouds in the night sky above. I couldn't take my eyes off her. After a moment, I quickly turned my gaze away as I started blushing again. Foxes are free animals. They would never cover their beauty because of shame like humans do. Although this certainly wasn't the first time I beheld her, every time the moonlight shone upon her long hair, I couldn't help but blush and look away. She turned her face in thought for a moment, and let out a gentle sigh. She seemed rather displeased. We sat amidst the dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with me. \"We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish.\" The fox said, turning her face towards me. Her lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace. Thank goodness, she wasn't mad at me. For some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/The_Fox_in_the_Dandelion_Sea/#vol-9","title":"Vol. 9","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>When I have taught all that there is to teach, will it be possible to see this sea of dandelions again...? In the dandelion sea, the hunter starts to contemplate leaving.</p> <p>Foxes are clever animals. Clever and cunning. The little fox learned very quickly, and could sometimes even ask questions that would stump me. For human speech is complicated and intricate, nothing like the innocence of animal speech. Sometimes, language is like a yarn ball caught in the paws of a cat. It catches here and there, and there again it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up. But foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner. Every time the little fox discovered a new word, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us. The little fox learned very quickly, but I did not take much joy from that. When I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this dandelion sea? When that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight? Would she still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance that came from both the north and south winds? As I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen memory. Yes, that's right. On that night that I could no longer remember clearly, when I was about to part with the girl I loved, this same moon had hung in the sky as well. \"Thank you for everything up till now.\" Before I knew it, the fox had walked in front of me. She bowed, and her hair spilled over her shoulders, flowing like water in the glimmering moonlight. \"Once he has learned human speech, he should be able to make more new friends.\" \"I am truly thankful to you for all you've done. He has also cheered up significantly since beginning to learn the human language.\" She gazed at me, her deep, unfathomable eyes shining like jewels. \"Still, once you have finished teaching us the human language, where will you go then?\" Enraptured by those shining eyes, I forgot to reply. Was this fox magic, too? Seeing my wooden expression, the fox laughed and sighed. Then, she turned and began walking in the direction of the moon, leading me further into the center of the moonlit dandelion sea. Seeing this, the little fox swished its tail from side to side, and burrowed into the dandelion fields.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Mondstadt/The_Fox_in_the_Dandelion_Sea/#vol-10","title":"Vol. 10","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The somber parting has finally arrived...

His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away. After he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked over to me. The closer she drew, the greater in stature she became. By the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a human. She was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water \u2014 in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops. \"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\" I thought to myself. For all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the boundless dandelion sea. At last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth: \"Is this the magic you wanted to teach me? The magic of transformation?\" \"It is. I am most grateful to you for all your help over this long period.\" She bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams. Although saying farewell to the little fox left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to learn. Could I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef. \"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\" \"Then I shall ask you to stand still.\" She walked circles around me, her stature growing with every pass. No, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size! They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into towering trees.

It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royal to gloat over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace was during Ludi Harpastum. During one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The name of the lass was In\u00e8s, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads.  </p> <p>\"The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone!

But his religious piety filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity, which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more. As is known to all, the beliefs of contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city of tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the commoners, and the ravage of the dragon; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed \"orthodox\" church \u2014 a mere figurehead, controlled by the ruling class \u2014 advocated abstinence from earthly pleasure to avert divine punishment.

The Seneschal decided to send his adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct In\u00e8s. Octave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal.

How interesting.\" Though she was trying hard not to let Vera notice that she did not in fact care for the story at all, the Princess' acting skills required some work. \"So that can only mean that this place is on the polar opposite side of this world from the great king's capital, right?\" Ike said, commenting on a seemingly unimportant aspect of the tale. \"Ahahaha, that's true if you think about it.\" Vera rubbed the back of her head with a crooked smile.  </p> <p>\"I've always said that I want to leave this place, but in the end, I discovered that this is the place I'm most familiar with.\" Having come to this realization on the eve of the town's anniversary, Vera began crying right in front of Sachi's eyes. \"You numbskull!

Some of its pages are damaged and crumpled, and a few shimmering ice crystals are attached to them.</p> <p>I began my ascent of Dragonspine from its southern side, where the mountain meets the riverbanks and plains of Liyue. The mountain slopes gently here, the wind is soft, and the snow is light. Added to the unfrozen water sources, it makes this place a good choice for setting up a base camp. Once I have prepared my supplies, I will make a camp here before continuing my climb to the summit.  </p> <p>After setting up camp, I took the chance to survey the surrounding ruins. What intrigued me is that the architectural style and artistic patterns are strikingly similar to those seen in ancient buildings elsewhere. This could very well mean that the fabled mountain civilization of old is right beneath my feet. Unfortunately, I did not find any well-preserved inscriptions within the ruins, so there was no hard proof of the ancient civilization's historicity. Perhaps I will find more information is preserved further up the mountain, buried deep within the bitingly cold blizzards.  </p> <p>Spending the night here is an unpleasant experience. The cold, damp wind chills to the bone, and the way it shakes the tent sounds like the roar of a rushing river. Guaranteed nightmare material for once you do manage to fall asleep. There's a cave by the water, and it must be spacious in there because I can hear the ghostly groaning of the wind echoing inside. Unfortunately, the entrance is tightly fenced off and there is simply no way to get through from the outside.  </p> <p>I will start advancing further up the mountain a little later on. There are some remnants of the relatively recent past by the path, which if I'm not mistaken can be traced back to the era when Mondstadt was ruled by an aristocracy. I dug up some fragments of clothing and some irreparably damaged weaponry. The dense snow and ice seem to have slowed down the decomposition process, preserving any pieces of the past that they swallow up for a long time to come. The way that the items are distributed leads me to believe that a chase once took place here on this mountain path \u2014 or possibly even a murder.  </p> <p>It seems that even fierce blizzards and sinister mutations pose no obstacle to humans intent on following through on their dark ambitions. In the end, this archon-forsaken snowscape has become stained by mortal transgression.  </p> <p>As I climb further up the path, the wind becomes stronger and the temperature plummets to an unbearably low level. I scouted out a ruin to the northeast, where to my utter astonishment I found water! It was somehow unfrozen, in defiance of its perennially blizzard-beaten surroundings. From the location, I would estimate that it is linked to the stream I saw further downhill. However, this area is so cold that I could not afford to explore deeper inside the ruin for the risk of freezing to death or drowning. I left a makeshift sign there to mark the spot \u2014 I just hope that it doesn't get buried in the snow. I suppose that once upon a time this could have been an underground shelter and that over the years the groundwater has seeped in and flooded it. But I have also heard that the tyrants of the distant past were partial to a form of punishment whereby they would jail a prisoner, lock them in a cage, and then slowly pour water in. Just so they could force the prisoner to watch in alarm as the water slowly rose up from their ankles to their mouth, nose, and finally their forehead... Such a cruel and drawn out punishment... And in the sheer cold of this climate, it is all the more impossible to imagine that any managed to survive it.  </p> <p>Further to the east, the road becomes more rugged. I had a stupid accident and very nearly broke my leg because of it. I was lucky to only receive a superficial wound and no major bone injury. But it also tore a great big hole in my windproof clothing, so now I feel the full force of the wind right against my skin. It feels awful, like being stabbed constantly with a sharp knife. I managed to find shelter from the wind before my wound went completely numb. I just about managed to sew my clothing back up, but there's no way I can continue to the summit like this. I made it back to camp, finally, on the verge of freezing to death. As I warmed my feet by the bonfire, I removed my socks to find that three of my toes had turned purple from the cold... But no matter, right now I'm still enjoying the feeling of coming back to life after such a close brush with death.  </p> <p>When the storm died down a little, I looked up and caught a view of the peak, towering there silently against the dark sky, encircled by giant jagged rocks and yet secluded among them in the center. The bards' songs tell of an ancient, evil dragon who lies buried there in the mountain stream \u2014 I wonder if it, too, yearns for the celestial heights even as it gazes up with its rotting and blinded eyes? Many villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction. Yet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain. I heard its call in my dream. It was like a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind.  </p> <p>This trip was a disaster, but at least I came out of it alive. Farewell for today, Dragonspine. Perhaps I shall return, though I do not know if I will ever make it to your summit... I think I will explore Liyue next. But first things first, my top priority is replenishing my lost supplies.

The pages are littered with a small amount of shiny but bitter salt crystals.</p> <p>My shoes are completely waterlogged after trekking here from the banks of Dihua Marsh. The last time I took them off to pour the water out, a frog jumped out.  </p> <p>From the scale of this ruin, I suspect it is the temple that provided safe refuge for civilians during the Archon War several millennia ago. I've heard that the God of Salt built such a place. Liyue folklore holds that she was the gentlest of the gods. In the brutality and chaos of wartime, human beings were puny and disposable. But the Salt God refused to join the other gods in their senseless battle for dominance, instead choosing to give shelter to those dispossessed by the war. She brought them here to build a new settlement. She showed them kindness and comfort. And even as global upheaval ushered in the end of an epoch, she worked tirelessly to bring about a return to peace between the gods.  </p> <p>It seems that most parts of the ancient city have sunk into the riverbed of Bishui River. It's fortunate that the foundation of the temple is still here after all this time.  </p> <p>She amassed a group of followers who settled in the area now known as Sal Terrae and lived a humble existence. The city stood for several centuries, finally falling with the downfall of the god herself.  </p> <p>The gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own people, the people she had loved so dearly.  </p> <p>He was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might, in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth.  </p> <p>As for the treacherous king's fate, theories abound but none are certain. Some say he continued to reign in solitude from the ruins for centuries, finally turning to dust long after the cries of war had subsided, the ruins had been engulfed by the river, and insects had hollowed out his scepter. Other say that he took his own life after taking that of the god, unable to bear the guilt of deicide that weighed upon his conscience. In any case, the people on whom the Salt God had once looked so fondly became scattered across Liyue. In the safe haven of Liyue Harbor, under the rule of the Geo Archon, they and their stories survived, and that is why we still hear about them to this day.  </p> <p>Rumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword.  </p> <p>It looks like we're in for some heavy rain: dark clouds are gathering as far as the eye can see. I'd better get moving. I'm going to head northwest to Mt. Qingce. Hopefully I can make it there before the rain gets too heavy.

My shoes and clothes were all soaked from the heavy rain. Luckily, the elders in the village were kind enough to let me hang my clothes in the assembly hall. They even prepared dry clothes and some food for me. There were many children in Qingce Village. Sweet as they may be, they can become quite clingy. There were also many elders here. People living here seemed happy and carefree. The elders said that most of the young people had gone to work in Liyue Harbor. Many of them already had a family there and they would send money back every month. Having seen the prosperity and convenience of the city, it's hard for these young people to go back to the rural life here. Liyue Harbor has brought peace and prosperity to Qingce Village for the time being, but eventually it will also be the cause of its demise. Legend has it that the word \"Qingce\" originated from the name of an ancient monster \"Chi.\" \"Chi,\" of course, is what we call it now in the contemporary language. But in ancient times, the people of Liyue pronounced it as \"Qingce.\" An elder said that thousands of years ago, Morax defeated the sea serpent and brought peace back to Liyue. After Chi died, its body turned to stone, its blood became water, and its scales are now the terraced fields. The monster's nest became what we now call Mt. Qingce. But after a quick look, I believe the mountains consist of mostly rocks shattered by impacts from the outside. No traces of a hydro monster can be found in the rocks. Perhaps the corpse of Chi is long gone and this monster-turning-into-a-mountain thing is nothing but an ancient tale? My next destination is the lake located amongst the stone peaks of Jueyun Karst.

I waste so much paper every year... I do hope the Dendro Archon won't mind.  </p> <p>I have arrived at a mountain lake located high on Mt. Aocang. To get here, I had to hike up a winding dirt trail, make my way across perilous wooden walkways built by herb gatherers in ancient times, and then scale a steep, wet cliff. I was told by some fishermen that the lake is a thousand furlongs deep, but after taking a dip in the water I can safely say that their statements were pure hyperbole.  </p> <p>The Qingce Village elders were right after all: the mountain lake's water is sweet and warm. This place certainly lives up to its reputation as a celestial paradise! Back when I had just arrived in Jueyun Karst, an old farmer told me that the adepti possess a mysterious magical ability that lets them turn into mist and roam in the sea of clouds. I dismissed it as an old wives' tale at the time, but seeing the way the mist over the lake rises up to the summit and merges together with the sea of clouds, it does make me wonder... The adeptus I've been searching for could be roaming the clouds at the summit right now, for all I know, and I would be completely oblivious to it.  </p> <p>I headed east down Mt. Aocang and ended up thoroughly lost in a thick forest. Finally, I came to a clearing and discovered I was back at the banks of the Bishui River. I have an excellent view of the surrounding area here, so I think this is where I'll camp for the night.  </p> <p>While I was sorting through my things at the camp, I met a young lady who looked like she was out on a treasure hunt. She was called Eduardo, and she explained that she was heading west to look for a \"Miraculous Lake\" at the foot of Mt.

If that's true, then that's sure to be where the adeptus keeps their secret treasure, too...

I'd contact the Guild, and report to them if I found it! I am a proud member of the Adventurers' Guild, and I have absolutely no connection to the Treasure Hoarders!\"  </p> <p>Indeed, some adventurers are in the business for material wealth alone. I'm reminded of that classic Liyue saying, \"To each their unfathomable own\"... But whatever her motivations, she is a fellow adventurer nonetheless, and a genuine one at that.  </p> <p>I must say, I was tempted to head west in search of this fabled \"Miraculous Lake\" myself after hearing Eduardo talk about it. But in the end I decided to stick with my existing plan. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I will proceed to the Guili Plains to see what sights and treasures are waiting to be discovered there. And hopefully I won't lose my diary again this time \u2014 again, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I can't lose another one...

I heard the sound of some unknown monsters coming from the fog, but couldn't quite tell their exact location. All that was left to do was set up the tent and wait for this blasted fog to drift away. When I was staying at the Wangshu Inn, a merchant told me about the legends of Yaoguang Shoal. He started with a poem \u2014 \"Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a conch lay empty on the white shoal.\" The meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang Shoal has been unoccupied for some time. I once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see the owner. A legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus \u2014 the green conch itself, in fact, constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters. But older fishermen interpret the legend differently. They say that the Seashell Sanctuary was not the abode of an adeptus, but of a family that had lived in the giant seashell for generations. They devoted themselves to helping the lost and saved many fishermen's lives. It seems the fog is drifting away and the sun is almost visible now.

A good night's sleep is therefore out of the question.

Honestly, I don't think I can keep calling myself an adventurer if I lose my diary one more time... a misadventurer, perhaps.  </p> <p>I headed westward from the mountain pass at Mt. Tianheng and came to a ruin, known locally as Qingxu Pool. The entrance to the ruin is located right in the center of a giant rocky outcrop rising up from the center of a shallow pool. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliff faces. There are several stone towers which blend in seamlessly with the natural scenery put here by the Geo Archon. The morning mist is beginning to clear and the first rays of sunlight are starting to illuminate the mountains and ruins. It looks like it'll be good weather today.  </p> <p>Legends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples.  </p> <p>Back when I was at the Wangshu Inn I met a scholar from Sumeru called Soraya. She had done a fair bit of research on the ruins in Lisha. Once she got talking about it she could talk all day. What she told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided.  </p> <p>Maybe these crumbling remains have been left as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era for the adepti and the other deities. In any case, this is a calm and tranquil place that has, for whatever reason, remained entirely unperturbed by the relentless development of Liyue Harbor and untouched by the mining operation based at the Chasm. It has just been left, as-is, right to this day. Perversely, the only disturbances have come since the mining at the Chasm has been halted, as monsters have now occupied the ruins here. Let's just hope they don't destroy anything.  </p> <p>It is a simple theory, but I need to gather more evidence. I should keep heading north and visit the ruins at Lingju Pass and Dunyu.  </p> <p>I ran into Eduardo again just before I set off. She seemed to be traveling with a partner this time.

The Sakoku Decree has been in effect for some time. While many travelers have chosen to stay on the island, many come and go, staying for only a brief period. Many merchants also packed up and went home. Ritou, in its current state, is a gloomy and depressing place. It is said that hundreds of years ago, Hiroshi of the Hiiragi Clan built this commercial port. He recruited talented merchants to set up shop here and encouraged free trade. Ritou flourished and prospered for some time... But poor Hiroshi would probably turn in his grave if he knew of the state that Ritou is in right now. Still, his descendant, the current Kanjou Commissioner, seems to be living the good life. It's enough to leave anyone feeling rather resentful.  </p> <p>After a few days, Mr. Kurisu brought me some good news. He's heard that the Crux Fleet will stop by briefly in Inazuma. There should be a way for this famous armed fleet to smuggle me to another island, he said. I just need to be patient. I don't know if Mr. Kurisu's information is reliable, but it's always a good idea to be prepared. First, I must think of a way to get my camp-making and fire-starting tools back from Miss Yurika.

The few outlanders who remain have all been gossiping. Even those in service of the Commissioner have been spreading various rumors without fear.

At his direction, I tried to penetrate the thick fog that shrouds the island and somehow managed to catch a hurried glimpse of the ancient civilization present here, as well as certain dream-like landscapes. However, these memories seem to have dispersed just like a mist might... But I can still clearly remember meeting a small child on this supposedly long-dead island.  </p> <p>Perhaps he was nothing but a hallucination I saw under the influence of Elemental Particles floating through the fog, or perhaps the mushrooms on the island were to blame...

As the door closed behind her, the bell that hung from it rang out, its crisp and clear sound filling the room and cutting through the dimly lit drudgery. The dull glow of twilight seeped gently through the frosted glass of the display case windows. Stacks of curious objects filled every part of the room. Veiga made her way through the store cautiously, for fear of stepping on something and breaking it. There was no answer. Veiga now began to examine the objects around her more closely: an obscure mechanical component, an ornate ancient lyre, a broken ceramic tile engraved with incomprehensible markings, a pair of old manacles, dented and scratched from years of use, a forgotten crown that once belonged to an aristocrat... At some point as she was inspecting these objects of no apparent utility, the shopkeeper appeared beside her. The shopkeeper's eyes were like those of a fox, with long, slender pupils at their center. \"That fang once belonged to a wolf king. Aside from the gods, it is probably the only thing left that remembers that land the way it used to be... every inch of it covered in ice and snow.\" She spoke softly, \"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"  </p> <p>\"Do you have anything here that can help someone... to forget?\" \"Why, certainly.\" Veiga clutched her chest as she pursued the question further. \"...To forget anything? Even... someone very important?\" The fox-eyed shopkeeper's expression turned stern, and she nodded as she continued: \"I know that the one you wish to forget is a young man with limpid eyes as clear as moonlight. He disappeared a long time ago, and left a deep hole in your heart. Nothing else can fill that hole... all other blessings, no matter how joyful they may be, feel elusive and out of your reach... just like the moonlight before your eyes.\" Veiga was stunned into silence. All she could do was nod along. The fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled and, seemingly out of nowhere, presented a bottle of wine. \"This wine will help you forget your pain.\" \"Long ago in the age when the icy winds blew, our forebears brewed this wine in secret, deep within the frozen earth, to give them the strength to keep surviving. The method they used to brew this kind of wine was forgotten when the people's fate took a turn for the better, and their lives became more joyful.\" She tilted the wine bottle back and forth. \"There is not much left. And since it seems you have an affinity with this store, this one is for free. Provided, of course, that this is what you really want...\" Veiga took the goblet of wine from the fox-eyed shopkeeper's hand. The goblet must once have been adorned with a precious gemstone. But it had since been removed, and now the only clue to its existence was the empty, lonely indentation it had left behind...  </p> <p>When Veiga regained consciousness she was stood in front of the fountain. \"Hmm? What am I doing here?\" She wondered to herself. As the moon shone down brightly, she began briskly walking back home. The glow of twilight had all but disappeared now, and if she didn't get back soon... She had forgotten all about the strange store, from the route that had taken her there to everything that had happened inside.  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>\"She's gone.\" The fox-eyed shopkeeper said, after the door had shut and the bell had stopped ringing. A young man, one with limpid eyes as bright as moonlight, stepped into view from the back of the store. \"Thank you.\" \"How many times has she visited now?\" \"Six... No, seven. Seven times.\" The young man hesitated for a moment, and then asked, \"Does the wine really work? It's not that I don't trust you, it's just\u2014\" The shopkeeper smiled, though the meaning of her smile was ambiguous. \"This wine causes those who drink it to forget their pain. But your shared history is not a painful thing for her. All this wine can do is to help her temporarily forget her longing for you, and the grief of losing you...\" \"Whenever she sees the moonlight, she will see you reflected in it, and the memories will start coming back... the time you met at Ludi Harpastum, the afternoon spent beneath the tree at Windrise, the view from Cape Oath, the time you sneaked out of the midsummer celebrations together, hand in hand, the song and the feathered cape you offered to her at the assembly of the traveling bards... All of these are memories she will be reluctant to part with.\" \"...I do have another bottle of wine in my shop, one that can make someone truly forget everything. If you wish... I could give her that to drink, instead?\" She smiled slightly as she watched the young man. After a long silence, he let out a sigh.  </p> <p>\"Tell me \u2014 why do you insist on leaving her?\" \"Ah, well... it's this. This is the reason.\" The young man reached into his breast pocket and took out a spherical object made of crystal. Unknown symbols could be discerned faintly flickering inside it. \"I am led to believe that people who receive one of these will one day disappear from this world.\" \"If that is so, then the earlier I leave the better. She is still young... if she forgets me now, then she will still have time.\" \"Well, well, well...\" sneered the shopkeeper. \"So. You are one of the chosen.\" \"It would appear so. But do you... know anything about what happens to the chosen in the end?\" The young man asked eagerly. She forced a smile, but did not reply. \"I should be leaving. Now I am the owner of this thing, I suppose I should get on with doing the things that are expected of me.\" \"And if she returns? What would you have me do?\" \"I think...

The bell continued to ring after the door had closed and as he made his way further inside. The faint sound of crashing waves seeped into the store, like a distant memory. Piles of seemingly random artifacts were stacked all the way through from where he stood to the other end of the long and narrow shop. Yu'an looked apprehensively at the range of items throughout the store, somewhat intimidated by the thought of his silken robes being covered in dust that was potentially even older than he. Old lanterns made of now-yellowing paper, a giant fang from some unknown monster, brilliant black aerosiderite from the depths of space, a dull gold-colored geometric object built with a mortise and tenon crafted from an unknown material... As he picked up a small bottle filled with a fine white crystalline powder, he heard a soft voice coming from someone who was now stood next to him. \"That is salt formed from the residue of an ancient archon's tears\u2014\" The voice caught him off guard, breaking the long silence like a stone disrupts the surface of a pool of still water. Startled, he dropped the bottle he held in his hand. But the sound of smashing glass his ears were anticipating never came.

Huh, I can't remember who it was, but... someone recommended this place to me.\" She gave a slight nod that acknowledged she had heard him, but was ambiguous as to what she thought about it. \"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\" \"I'm looking for a gift for... she's a girl I like.\" \"I've been thinking of proposing to her, and I'd like to have a gift to go with it.\" Yu'an nervously bit his lower lip as he looked up to face the shopkeeper directly. She had mysterious golden eyes that reminded him of Cor Lapis. They looked at each other for a long time in silence. Finally, she spoke: \"Very well.\"  </p> <p>Her slender figure disappeared back into the depths of the store. When she returned, she held in her hand an object that gave off a faint iridescent glow. On closer inspection, it was revealed to be an exquisitely cut ten-sided illuminating crystal. \"I trust you will have heard the legend of the crystal heart?\" He hadn't. But he nodded anyway. \"It is made from a variety of crystal called illuminating crystal. Man-made versions exist, but they are pale imitations. True illuminating crystal is capable of revealing the secrets of one's heart, for it is formed from the unfulfilled desire and grief of illuminated beasts of the highest order when they reach the end of their life. Please, take a look...\" She gestured to Yu'an that they should both watch the faintly flashing images emerging from within the crystal. Tens of thousands of years flashed by before his eyes. Like the continuous shifting of the clouds, stars turned to water and water turned to land. Snow melted and gave way to green pastures. Rivers cut their way through the open country. He watched cities rise like ants' nests and kingdoms topple like toy building blocks...  </p> <p>...The twilight grew dim. Moonlight zigzagged its way across the uneven surface of the ocean. When Yu'an regained consciousness, he found himself walking by the docks. The crystal he held tightly in his hand had become warm, as if blood pulsed through it. \"This is a wondrous crystal heart indeed,\" he thought to himself, increasing his pace as he walked on under the moonlight. \"All I need to do is give this to her...

He said that if we looked into it together, we would see many marvelous things.\" \"But somehow I just find it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's a beautiful gem, of course, I just... each time I think of him, I get so exasperated. So I wondered if this store would be willing to take it off my hands.\" \"I understand. But this is a highly prized ten-sided illuminating crystal. For what quantity of Mora would you be willing to part with it?\" \"Actually, I do not want for money. But let me see... what's this \u2014 it looks like salt? It's about time I went to Sal Terrae to pay my respects again.

After all, happiness is but a state of mind \u2014 it is not related to love.\" She took a dainty sip of wine, and smiled mockingly at the thought of her own vanity. \"But the fact is, I simply have zero tolerance for people like that.\" \"On the other hand, it is delightfully straightforward opening up to a complete stranger. I know that once he sets foot outside that door, we never have to meet one another again \u2014 so what does it matter if I reveal a little truth to him?

Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\" \"I have an item I wish to exchange.\" Her tone sounded cold but fragile, like thin ice in the moment that it shatters. As the sorceress spoke, she placed a giant blue crystal onto the counter. \"A burglar pried this from an aristocrat's silver goblet. He gave it to me as a gift, and then I was punished by my master for it.\" \"But that was many years ago. I had thought that with the passage of time my anger would be quenched and my desire to see him again would fade away...\"  </p> <p>\"Very well. What sum of Mora do you ask for in return?\" The sorceress gestured toward the tableware cabinet, in which stood an aristocrat's silver goblet with its gemstone missing. The fox-eyed shopkeeper turned the crystal in her hand, flooding the room with the brilliant blue light that reflected off its surface. \"I see. Well, provided that this is what you really want...\"  </p> <p>When a person encounters a setback, the worry that everything shall come to a fruitless conclusion appears. The advent of fear causes cracks to appear in the mind. Death follows easily in the footsteps of fear, like a damp cold that, to the unprepared, pierces to the bone.

Just as legends claim that somewhere in the world, there is a field of dandelions as vast as the sea.

To reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the clamor of the city streets, then wait until complete silence replaces the sound of the voices in the background, the only remaining sound being that of one's own heartbeat. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>\"Is anybody in?\" The man tapped on the front door as he called out. He was draped in a raincoat. He peered in through the dusty windows at the objects on display around the store \u2014 a bottle of glimmering stardust, a broken blade that gleamed like ice, a painting on a roll of paper that the years had turned yellow, an elixir that gave off a mysterious aurora, a tile thinly coated with a gel-like substance... He entered the store. The door closed behind him. He walked over to the counter and began inspecting the weird and wonderful objects in the store. All seemed to be relics from a bygone era. Then, a soft female voice came from beside him. \"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"  </p> <p>Taken by surprise, he turned to face the speaker, a fox-eyed shopkeeper, who let out a faint smile. \"Here's the thing... I'm looking for a certain something that can help me settle an old score.\" The man spoke with a voice that was clear and resonant, but that had a hint of apprehensiveness about it \u2014 one which did not seem to fit with his physical appearance. \"Oh? Very well then.\" The shopkeeper's golden fox-like eyes flickered as she examined this new customer of hers who was draped in a soaking-wet raincoat. She gave a nod. She leaned down to search in the bottom of the cabinet. When she stood up a moment later, she was holding a large and beautiful piece of Cor Lapis.  </p> <p>The Cor Lapis in the shopkeeper's hand gently glowed a dark shade of gold, much in the same way that her eyes did. The man took the stone from her hand and studied it closely in the moonlight. In this light, the Cor Lapis seemed to reveal a deep turbulence concealed within its soft golden hue. His hands were still trembling.  </p> <p>\"Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks. Even the hardest and most resilient of rocks will, over time, eventually produce a pure, limpid soul.\" The shopkeeper's voice seemed to be coming from a distant place. The man gave a nod. \"This is precisely what I was looking for.\" The man solemnly responded, and placed a heavy sack of Mora upon the counter. Then, he left the store and ventured off into the midnight rain.  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>\"That's what happened.\" After the shopkeeper had spoken, she narrowed her fox-like eyes and examined the customer in front of her. \"Did he say nothing else at all?\" Judging by his appearance, the young man was presumably a miner. His eyes betrayed an urgency that he could not contain. But the shopkeeper responded simply by calmly shaking her head. \"He left a sack of Mora with blood stains on the outside.\" Like a pool of water, the shopkeeper's voice was calm and still, but also icy cold.  </p> <p>\"That is precisely what I was looking for.\" The young man let out a long sigh. It seemed he wanted to evade the golden gaze of the fox-eyed shopkeeper. \"In return, I will give you a story.\" The shopkeeper nodded her head to indicate that he should continue. \"That man in the raincoat... I used to go mining with him, up in the mountains. I wanted to make a name for myself. He just wanted to support his family...\" \"One rainy night we broke open a rock to find that substantial piece of Cor Lapis inside. The pure golden glow that radiated from its surface was a more breathtaking sight to behold than all the marvels of Jueyun Karst put together...\" \"We agreed that we would split it fifty-fifty once we got back to Liyue Harbor. But that night, under cover of the deafening roar of the torrential rain... I discreetly made it so that that clifftop would be his final resting place...\" \"I did it because I was scared I couldn't trust him... I couldn't trust in a promise that, aside from ourselves, only the adepti could have heard \u2014 and they're probably imaginary anyway.\" \"So... Fear won me over. I could bring myself to accept that the whole sum could be mine if I was willing to get blood on my hands, but I couldn't bring myself to accept the risk of traveling with a stranger...\"  </p> <p>\"The following morning, I let down my rope and began my descent down the cliff. I had taken maybe four steps, five or six perhaps, and I was adjusting my footing on a rock when suddenly, I felt the rope trembling in the palms of my hands... Instantly that same trembling permeated every fiber of my being...\" \"I lifted my head to look at the rope, but it was too late...\" \"The last thing I remember seeing was the torn rope fibers at the end of the snapped rope.\" \"Only a hunting knife could have made a clean cut like that. I am sure of it.\"  </p> <p>\"Then, in the end, you two settled your score.\" The fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled so faintly it was all but indiscernible. \"He takes the Cor Lapis, and you take the whole sum of money for it.\" The young man did not say much in reply.  </p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  </p> <p>Legends claim that Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks of the earth, and that the stronger the life force of the rock the more power it possesses to reveal a person's true nature. Some say that even after its owner has left the world, Cor Lapis will bring their unfulfilled desire and regret back into it, waiting for one with the ability to fulfill them. So the legends claim. It had now been around four hours since the two strange customers had left the store. The rain continued to pour down. The shopkeeper stood by the window for a long time, peering out at the dark street engulfed in misty rain. \"But... Is the score truly settled? And are they now truly free? \" She spoke as if posing her question to the curtain of rain, but knowing that the answer would never come.</p>"},{"location":"books/Multiregional/Hex_and_Hound/","title":"Hex &amp; Hound","text":""},{"location":"books/Multiregional/Hex_and_Hound/#vol-1","title":"Vol. 1","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Sometimes, feelings are like the summer rain, coming out of nowhere and catching you unprepared. A nostalgic summer story set in the age of aristocrats begins right here.  </p> <p>As is known to all, the Lawrence Clan is a noble family of considerable notoriety. The nobles idle away their time, extorting the common folk to furnish their lavish lifestyles. They lead licentious lives. Under their cruel governance, countless unspeakable crimes are committed against the people. Although the common folk unanimously resent the nobles' greed, they are powerless to speak a single word against them.  </p> <p>Young Dietrich was a highborn noble. He hadn't yet committed any deplorable crimes at his tender age. In fact, his swordsmanship was reputedly exceptional among the noble circles. If you wished to find something to cavil about, it would have been his short temper and chronic delusion that the whole universe revolved around him. Such traits, of course, are not uncommon among the sons of nobility, so it wasn't of any major concern. However, given that he was born into the Lawrence family name, it was only a matter of time before he would get drafted into the ranks of the other scoundrels.  </p> <p>It was at this time that the young scoundrel decided upon the first reckless act of his life. A short while earlier, Dietrich had made up his mind to skip the Grand Mage's discourse on the elements in favor of a bit of fun outside the confines of the city. As he pressed his way through the streets crowded with commoners, his gaze fell upon a young lass with blonde hair and blue eyes. Dietrich was at a loss for words for the emotions that bubbled in his heart at that moment. The only thing he was certain of was that his heart had never thumped so loudly, or so uncontrollably, within his chest. \"So this must be how dear Mother feels when she sees her kitty.\" As Dietrich kept thinking in his heart, he suddenly found himself moving towards where she was standing.  </p> <p>Much to his dismay, the young commoner girl didn't so much as bat an eyelid at him. After making his identity known to her, she didn't display even the slightest sign of any interest. Convinced that this commoner didn't understand what was good for her, he decided that he would carry her off under the cover of night.  </p> <p>\"Once I take her, I'll lock her away in a cage, just like dear Mother would when her kitty is being naughty.\"  </p>"},{"location":"books/Multiregional/Hex_and_Hound/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Money doesn't solve all your problems, but it can certainly solve a lot of them!

Her long golden hair shone like the spring sunshine, and her blue eyes sparkled like the gleaming waves in the afternoon sun. It's hard to imagine how such a girl could travel alone from the monster infested outskirts all the way to the city.  </p> <p>\"To call her suspect would only be an insult to her beauty!\" Thus shouted the drunken gate sentry among the clamor of the crowded tavern. His earnings from guarding the gate that day were especially bountiful, enough to keep his cup brimming until dawn at least. \"We all know you were just dumbstruck by her beauty!\" The man next to him pulled no punches. \"Hah, what do you know! Do I look like one to go frolicking after ladies? I'll show you what I really have my eye on!\" The soldier promptly pulled out his money purse and shook it in his hand. \"Good heavens!

It seemed to be the cry of a wolf. Nottie sat on her bed and lifted her long sleeves to reveal a bone-white armband carved in the fashion of a coiling snake. The serpent's head was strikingly lifelike with its mouth stretched open to reveal its fangs. Its neck was reared back as if ready to pounce on its prey the very next moment. The snake's slithering body was wrapped around her arm, emitting a dangerous aura under the rays of the magical lamps that lit the room. \"Goodnight, my dear sister.\" Nottie gently petted the armband, rubbing her pinkie playfully along the snake's tail. Shortly after, the magic lamps went out and the entire room was draped in darkness.  </p> <p>The darkness of night brought Nottie boundless power. So Nottie was already wise to the unknown presence the moment it entered the room.

She stroked the hilt of the blade for a moment before pulling back her hand, and a black gemstone that had been inlaid in the hilt fell into her palm.  </p> <p>\"How convenient... You have brought the Eye of Eternal Night right to me. Thank you.\" Removing the snake armband as she spoke, she placed the black gemstone in the mouth of the snake. Scales and flesh began to quickly ripple from the snake's head down its body. A small black snake uncoiled in Nottie's hands, slithering off her palm and falling to the floor. The snake began to enlarge, forming into a massive python with red eyes and black scales, its twisting body almost filled the whole room. Nottie extended her hand and as the magical lamps illuminated the room, the python began to shrink down again and coiled back around her arm.  </p> <p>\"Hmm?

I do hope you're going to bed on time and not causing any trouble for grandma and grandpa. I'll be back from Inazuma very soon, and I promise when I get back I'll take you to see The Crux's ship down at the harbor. I won't let you down this time!  </p> <p>Dongdong, do you remember the beach at Yaoguang Shoal? Well I went there, and I collected lots and lots of beautiful, golden sand. More than I can carry by myself. When I'm back, we should buy up the local mill and make fresh tofu every single day. Although, I'd rather use all this gold to buy a house in Liyue Harbor. A huge house with a splendid sea view. I'll let you decide how to spend it when I'm back. How does that sound?  </p> <p>Guess what? Just opposite Luhua Pool at the Guili Plains there's an enormous cliff, and what did I find there? A Ruin Guard! He was just sitting there, slumped over, completely still. He didn't flinch even in the thunder and lightning, not even when the rain was pelting down on him. Then I realized, he must be sleeping! So I climbed up on top of him, threw my arms around that big old head of his, and twisted it as hard as I could. There was a clunking noise, followed by a loud boom, and suddenly his head fell off and rolled straight off the cliff! It smashed into a million pieces at the bottom. Shame really, otherwise I would have brought it home as a trophy, and you could have had a proper up-close look at what a Ruin Guard's head looks like. Imagine that!  </p> <p>I also went to Jueyun Karst. I must take you there when you're older. The scenery there is incredible. The billowing clouds look like an ocean, the waterfall is infinitely better than the one in Qingce Village, and you can sometimes catch a glimpse of the realm of the adepti in the mountains. You can't begin to imagine how beautiful it was. And guess what? You're not going to believe this but... I met an actual, real-life adeptus! We sat and drank together, chatting and laughing away... The adeptus gave me a gift, too: a magic wine bottle. All you need to do is blow on it, and an infinite supply of wine will flow from the inside! You absolutely mustn't touch it though, do you understand? You're way too young to drink. When you're older, though, all my treasures will be yours to do with as you please.  </p> <p>My adventures in Liyue are coming to an end. It's time for me to head to the harbor, where I'll hop on The Crux's ship and sail off to somewhere even further away. I'm excited to see what wonderful sights and valuable treasures are waiting for me at the next stop, and I can't wait to share them all with you! Until then, Dongdong, please make sure you go to bed on time every night. And don't eat too many sweets, they'll rot your teeth. Please also be nice to your grandma and grandpa \u2014 seriously, don't do anything to make them mad. And no fighting!

It is said that the original work truly did contain countless tales and that naught but a fragment of that is still extant today.</p> <p>Once, this land was home to a group of a people without shadows. They led simple lives, knowing nothing about the world outside the place where they lived. This lasted until one day, when a lost adventurer discovered them. The shadowless folk were shocked to find that the adventurer had a lockstep attendant, silent and loyal. The adventurer, too, was shocked to see that people lived in the world who would not cast a shadow because of the sunlight. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would make such a discovery,\" said the adventurer. \"Dreams? We have not had those in a long time,\" said one of the shadowless people. \"Our elders tell us that all dreams have already been dreamed.\" \"Shadows hide the secrets of the soul. You have no shadows, and that is why you do not dream,\" said the adventurer. \"Perhaps you did once have shadows, just like you once did dream.\" \"If that is so, where shall I go to find that which I have lost?\" \"Go to the secret forest. Many dreams dwell there, and perhaps those who capture dreams there may have some extras to share with you.\" And so, the young shadowless person left his homeland behind, traveling far off to visit the secret forest the adventurer had spoken of. This forest was filled with layers of shadows: the shadows of the clouds, tree canopies... Even the tiny birds cast large shadows over the soft soil. Day after day, he passed between the crisscrossed shadows. Shadows hide the soul's secrets, he thought, and perhaps he was the only one here without any secrets. And so, one day, he discovered that all dreamscapes were open to him, for he had no dreams, but it was because of this that he could enter the dreams of others. In the many dreams he witnessed, the birds dreamed of vivid colors, the tiger of fragrant scents, but he did not see those who capture dreams, nor did he discover the excess dreams that were spoken of. The dreams, the shadows, and the beings that dwelt here could be matched one for one... and so he wondered if the adventurer had cheated him, and if there really was no such thing as a masterless dream, just as there was no such thing as a shadow without a source. But just as he was about to admit defeat, the one who captures dreams found him. Their encounter happened within the dream of a seashell. He barged into its ending, searching for the white waves and the salty wind, but neither was to be found in its saddened aftertaste. \"Just like this shell, you do not belong to this forest.\" The speaker was a woman, and he quickly realized that she was the dream-captor spoken the adventurer spoke of, for her shadow had a strange, mottled texture, like drapery encrusted with gems. \"I have been looking for you,\" he said. \"Perhaps you have some extra dreams...\" \"They pass like the morning dew...\" She said, and there was no sadness in her voice. \"Masterless dreams cannot last long. I have tried many times, but they always dissipate in the end.\" \"...See, just like this seashell... We must both leave.\" Taking his hand, she led him from this fading dream bereft of white waves and salty winds. Beside a murmuring brook, she told him a great many stories, and taught him how to enter dreams. After that, she warned him multiple times concerning the taboos of the dream-captors, such as how they should never gaze repeatedly into another's dream, for their secrets are like a bottomless well. \"The nightmares are more cunning than you can imagine. Once they discover what you have done, they will arise like a swarm and drag you into the darkness. You will not be able to leave that place, the boundary where no shadows are. If you wait long enough, you will be able to make out meaningful words, names that linger in faded memories that no longer belong anywhere. And you know that you must not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out...\" \"I once believed that none of you had shadows,\" he said honestly. \"I once believed that dream-captors did not have their own dreams, which is why they collected those that belong to others.\" The woman did not reply, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf. But the young shadowless man was too eager for the answer, and though the dream-captor defended the shadows well, he found his chance nonetheless. Unlike the dreams of the forest beings, whose dream-gates were wide open, it was a rugged path that led to the dream-captor's dreamscape. It seemed evident to him that she had hidden her secrets in others' dreams, he thought, but what were her secrets? And whose dreams were these? The dream-captor's dream was many-layered, just like the secret forest, and so he lost his way, and before he knew it, the nightmares were upon him. \"I have broken the dream-captor's taboo, but even if I can see that bottomless well, I cannot find my answer,\" he thought. \"She said that if I stayed long enough, I might able to make out a name from their voices. At least that way, I will know whose dream this is.\" And so he allowed himself to be led into the depths, and just as the woman had warned him, it was a boundless, lightless realm. He listened then for the tiny sounds, hoping to find words that could point to a name. An unknown period of time passed before he finally heard a name amidst the scattered sounds. This sound had a strange, special attraction to him, and he could not help but recite it. Then he opened his eyes. \"I saw a strange sight,\" he said. \"I saw that a woman had entered my dreams and stolen them, stolen secrets of my soul that I didn't know existed, and since that day, I no longer had a shadow. And I heard her say this, and she called me...\" \"You know,\" she said, interrupting him, \"that one should not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out...\" The dream-captor sat by the murmuring brook, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf. \"That is but a tale about the dead. I have told you such tales before, but there are many more that have yet to be told.\" And so the dream-captor continued to tell the young man with no shadow a story that none have yet heard...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Sumeru/A_Thousand_Nights/#vol-2-the-tale-of-the-dastur","title":"Vol. 2 - The Tale of the Dastur","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A wandering researcher once walked through rainforest, desert, and city during a time of great catastrophe, collecting these stories along the way.

Unfortunately, he encountered a sandstorm and lost his way. But just as he was about to breathe his last, a young woman with amber eyes appeared before him. She parted the howling sands with the staff in her hand, and led him out of the desert.  </p> <p>It was already noon by the time they reached the village. She treated him to lunch at her home and offered to escort him back to Caravan Ribat. But, having seen her part the sands as if by some spell, and how she had chased the dark beasts along their path away, the Dastur refused to leave, instead asking if she could teach him the secret arts of ancient lands.  </p> <p>The mage replied that her amber eyes could see all that the living and the dead had seen. People without shadows, a bronze clock whose pendulum swings by the power of imagination, whales that have never left land, a city that only exists by the reflected moonlight upon a silver mirror, a scholar imprisoned within eternity, a high tower hanging upon seven strings. She could see that he had infinite potential and a boundless future ahead of him, and she was indeed willing to teach him all she knew. She had but one worry \u2014 that after learning all, he would seek his own profit and come to deny her.  </p> <p>The Dastur knelt to the ground and kissed the tip of her shoes, promising that he would never forget what she had done for him no matter what, and that he would never deny her, even if they should then die together. His earnestness touched the young mage, and smiling gently, she helped him up. Holding his hand, she brought him to the door to her basement, saying that she would indeed take him as her disciple, and that all her secrets were hidden in her underground library.  </p> <p>And so they walked down the winding stairs, level after level, with a mirror hung on the wall of each level, reflecting their faces and the feeble light of lit sconces. They walked for who knows how long \u2014 perhaps several hours, perhaps several minutes \u2014 for the darkness had obscured their sense of time. At the end of the stairs was a narrow gate, and behind the gate was a hexagonal library. He could not see the ceiling, nor could he estimate the height of this room, but the books in here nonetheless far surpassed all he imagined was possible for knowledge.  </p> <p>He learned well under her tutelage, but after a few weeks, envoys from the Temple of Silence would come to the Dastur and tell him that his mentor had passed on due to illness and that owing to his thesis passing review, the Akademiya had decided to make an exception for him and promote him to Herbad, that he might take over from his mentor and continue to educate more students. The newly-appointed Herbad was greatly pleased, and yet he was unwilling to leave yet, and so he carefully asked the mage if she could bring some of her books and come with him to the Akademiya, and there continue to teach him. She agreed to his invitation, but said that she had a sister who had always longed to learn at the Akademiya but was ultimately not accepted due to her desert heritage. She thus asked if the Herbad could take her own as an auditing pupil. The Herbad replied that the Akademiya had a strict testing process and that he could not make exceptions, not even to take someone on as an auditing pupil. The mage for her part said nothing more, simply packing her bags and following him to Sumeru.  </p> <p>Several years later, the sage of Vahumana passed on. Thanks to the earth-shaking theses he had been able to write and complete with the aid of the mage, it was unsurprising that the Herbad was recommended to become the new sage. The mage went to congratulate him, and asked if he might take her sister on as an auditing student now that he had his position as a sage. The newly-appointed sage rejected her, saying that he had no duty to do this, for he no longer needed her guidance, being someone who no longer needed to write theses. He advised her to return to her village and live out the rest of her days in peace. The mage said nothing more, and packing her bags, she returned to the desert.  </p> <p>Several years later, the Grand Sage too passed, and the Vahumana sage was selected to take the post. Hearing this news, the mage came hurriedly from the desert. Finding him, she knelt at his feet and kissed the tip of his shoe, reminding him of the promise he had made her and begging him to take those of her tribe who had been displaced by the sandstorms in and allow them to have refuge beneath the rainforest bower. The Grand Sage was furious and threatened to hurl her into a jail of bronze and leave her to die of starvation and thirst, for he did not know this charlatan of the desert wastes, and who was she, anyway, to coerce the Akademiya? The mage, no longer young, lifted her head, wiping the tears from her cheeks, and looked upon the Grand Sage one last time with her turbid amber eyes. She begged that she might be allowed to return to her village and help her tribespeople. Refusing, the Grand Sage had his soldiers bind her. And so the mage said little more to him save only this:  </p> <p>\"In that case, I must ask you, sir, to return to your own village.\"  </p> <p>The Grand Sage was startled, and when he had lifted his head, he found himself standing before Caravan Ribat. The night had grown long, and the distant village could no longer be seen clearly, shrouded as it now was in flying dust and sand and night's own cloak. The young woman stood before him, smiling, and her amber eyes reflected how he appeared at this moment: the Dastur of Vahumana, whose thesis had yet to pass review.  </p> <p>\"Well then, the hour is late, and you should return to the Akademiya now.

It is said that the original work truly did contain countless tales and that naught but a fragment of that is still extant today.</p> <p>Long, long ago, when Port Ormos was still ruled by the seafaring Deys, there was one valiant Dey amongst their number. He was the subjugator of countless isles and domains, thus obtaining many curious treasures and becoming second to none in wealth throughout the port. Yet the mariner's life had left him time for but a single son in his latter years, and passed away before the prince would reach adulthood. The Dey's son had inherited his great wealth, but had no power over those his father had administered. Guided by elders who lacked moral fiber, he quickly began to live the life of a sensuous animal. The prosperous streets of Port Ormos were like a beast that swallowed gold, and so the Dey's inheritance was emptied by the princeling within a few years, even saddling him with a massive debt in the process. By the time the prince came to his senses, the walls of his home were bare, with not a single Mora to be found within. After selling his estates and dismissing the servants, the prince, with nowhere to go, sought refuge at a shrine to an ancient patron god of mariners, which through the patronage of his father in turn had attained its current august stature. The prince asked the shrine's priest for aid thusly: \"Wise elder, I was once the son of a Dey who conquered the seven seas, but see, I have fallen this far due to my unconstrained extravagance. I beg that you have mercy upon me and show me a swift way through which I might clear my debts and ransom my estates. I promise that I will change for the better and become a man who knows his place.\" \"Young prince,\" the priest said, \"the fates of mortals have long been ordained by the gods, but they must accomplish those fates themselves. Since you desire to turn over a new leaf, should you not begin through hard work rather than relying on opportunism?\" The prince quickly replied, \"my father was a great patron of this shrine, so if we must argue, half of the golden statues and indeed, your expenses, should belong to me by right. And am I not here to claim this debt I am owed?\" \"Arrogant prince, will you make an enemy of the gods?\" The priest said with a sigh. \"Yet on your father's account, if you shall promise to keep to your place and manage your finances well, I shall tell you how to become wealthy.\" And so the prince swore to upon the divine statue, and the priest directed him to a street market at the outport. Coming to said market, the prince met a woman dressed in great finery tending to an emaciated Sumpter Beast. \"Esteemed lady,\" the prince asked, \"is there anything I might do for you?\" \"You've come at a good time,\" the woman replied. \"I must go out to sea on an urgent errand, and I fear that there is no one who can help me take care of this beast. But if you will aid me, I shall return in three months and pay you ten million Mora.\" The prince was overjoyed at this. \"But,\" the woman continued, \"you must not feed this beast till it is full, nor can you speak to it. Otherwise, even that which you own now, you shall lose.\" \"And what have I to lose?\" The prince thought to himself, and thus agreed readily. The woman then entrusted the Sumpter Beast to him. Three months passed quickly, and as the woman requested, not once did he completely fill the Sumpter Beast's stomach, nor did he speak one word to it, until the final day. On this day, the prince, excited at the thought of his soon-to-be reward as he sat before a fire, spoke to the Sumpter Beast, \"O good Sumpter Beast, it is thanks to you that I shall be rich again. If you have a request, name it, and I shall satisfy you.\" Hearing these words, the Sumpter Beast cried, \"O honored prince, I have no other wish but to have a full stomach on this last day.\" Hearing the Sumpter Beast speak, the prince was greatly shocked and allowed his curiosity to take over, forgetting all about the woman's instruction. Turning around, he brought water and hay from the feeding trough. \"My most gentle prince,\" the now-full Sumpter Beast said slowly, \"I was once a god who served the heavens and ruled over many vassal kings of the desert, but I was cheated by that venomous witch and forced into this form. If you will have mercy upon me and release me into the desert, I swear upon the king of the blazing sun that I will grant you riches beyond counting, more by far than what that witch can give.\" The prince felt dubious about the Sumpter Beast's words, and so he decided to hide it, and then conceal himself in a corner to await the woman's return. She did indeed return the next day, only to find both prince and Sumpter Beast missing. \"Faithless wretch!\" The woman cursed. \"If I catch you, I shall seal you in the smallest magic bottle I find, and there you shall face eternal torment!\" Seeing her thus, the prince finally believed the Sumpter Beast's words. Once she had left, he prepared to release the poor animal. As it was about to leave, it said to him, \"O merciful prince, may all the desert gods defend you \u2014 I shall fulfill my promise to grant you endless riches and happiness. I ask only that you do not ask where they came from, or else, you will lose even that which you have now.\" Following the Sumpter Beast's directions, the prince came to a hidden place at the edge of the desert, and there he did indeed discover a mighty and luxurious palace. Its walls were decorated with gold and gems, and its gates were made of pure gold, with a lovely male servant leading many lovely ladies out of those great doors to receive him. And thus did the prince once again lead an opulent life. Each day, the male servant would bring him silver, gold, pearls, and gems. Rare delicacies and fine wine were his to enjoy, and each day brought unique dancing girls to keep him company \u2014 and such was his life for three years. But even in merriment and revelry could boredom be bred, and one day the prince woke from days of drunken stupor, and he thought to himself, \"I tired now of my life today, and am in need of new thrills. Now, was it not because I refused the instruction of the witch that I gained this life of mine? Who then may say if that Sumpter Beast did not hide something from me for fear that I might discover his secret? If I can find the source of this limitless wealth, surely greater happiness still shall be mine.\" And so the prince summoned his faithful servant, and said to him, \"my most loyal servant. Could you tell me of the source of the gold and gems, wine and spirits, and even these musicians and courtesans, that you bring before me each day?\" \"Of course, my respected master,\" the manservant replied. \"Each day, I traverse the lands between the desert and this place, and all that you enjoy is drawn thereof. Your lovely dancers were once swaying desert eels, the glittering gold are the endless sands, and the gourmet meals you enjoy are of my own personal make.\" \"And I, your loyal servant,\" the manservant paused, \"am naught but a humble scarab.\" Just as he finished speaking, the glorious palace dissolved in an instant, and the prince found that he was seated upon a squat sand dune, and there was nothing around him apart from crawling insects. After a long while, he regained his senses, and even through his shock and terror he felt the hand of grief and regret. And yet, what he had now lost could not easily be regained, and the prince was at last reduced to wandering, never to feel happiness again. From then on, he would tell anyone who wished to hear him speak this story...  </p>"},{"location":"books/Sumeru/A_Thousand_Nights/#vol-4-the-tale-of-the-researcher","title":"Vol. 4 - The Tale of the Researcher","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A wandering researcher once walked through rainforest, desert, and city during a time of great catastrophe, collecting these stories along the way. It is said that the original work truly did contain countless tales and that naught but a fragment of that is still extant today.</p> <p>Once upon a time, there lived a researcher, upon whom all the hallmarks of the haughty man of letters might be seen, though he himself \u2014 and we shall be generous to him here \u2014 was not the best amongst his peers. Knowledge is like a fruit, after all, and time quickly whittles its freshness away. If he cannot eat it all while it is still juicy and full, the rest shall taste like sweet decay. \"Time,\" the young researcher said, \"you truly are my hated foe \u2014 even more so than I consider my colleagues.\" Alas, innate characteristics such as laziness cannot be so easily shaken off. Thus did winters turn to summers and back again, bringing his \"hated colleagues\" glory and praise, while he was left with the scars of the bygone years. Perhaps this was some trick of fate, but our main character would indeed discover a way to make his wish reality \u2014 quite by accident, in fact. \"Time seems fair, though it is but a veneer. That I am not as quick-witted as others is not due to a lack of talent. Nay, 'tis but the cruelty of time...\" So thought the researcher, now no longer young. \"Now that my chance has come, I must use it well.\" And so he made this wish to the injured Jinni: \"I wish for time to be just... so that I might write better theses.\" The Jinni understood him quite easily, saying: \"All things come with a price.\" \"Well, yes, and I have clearly paid part of that toll,\" he said, shrugging. \"I have wasted my youth on pointless pursuits. Now that things have come to this point, I no longer desire common joys. I only wish to leave behind a work of stunning brilliance, that my name will be praised for generations. Nor do I wish for my work to be left on perishable ink and paper, but it shall instead be carved into stone. Thousands of years on, my marks shall still be left upon this world... and this way, I shall have my justice \u2014 I shall triumph over time.\" \"If that is your will,\" the Jinni replied noncommittally, fulfilling the researcher's wish nonetheless. But whether that was truly a Jinni or some demon in disguise was quite the matter of contention, especially in hindsight. Leaving this matter aside, the researcher whose wish was fulfilled found that everything had now become slow compared to his thinking. \"Good, good. Now then, my agility of mind shall not be a problem.\" At first, the researcher was most pleased. Now that he had ample slack, so to speak, there was much time for thoughtful consideration. The time it took for a sand grain to fall to the earth was not sufficient for him to raise his left hand to touch his forehead, but his mind could sprint during this time \u2014 from forest to desert, from vast plain to snowy tundra it could run indeed. He cursed that all the pages of a book could not be laid out flat, but had to be flipped one by one. But even had they been laid out before him, his eyeballs would have failed to move quickly enough. By the time his eyes had finished resting upon a single word, he would already have exhausted all vocabulary related to that word, and all imagination pertaining to that vocabulary. \"I think too much and write too little,\" the researcher thought afterward. \"I must use the most elegant words to write the most academically rigorous paper.\" But when he had penned the first word, his thoughts had already leaped to the conclusion. And so he had to constantly repeat the essay to himself, and as he silently dictated the text, it would become more and more refined. Yet, this could only happen in his mind \u2014 when all was said and done, his right hand had yet to even write seven words. And thus was this great work, comprised of the finest lexicon and the stoutest logic, compromised by the researcher's own body. Every passage came out tattered, as if someone had shredded every page and put them back together haphazardly. The words that were connected felt like fragments randomly selected from a complete text, and no one could really grasp the connection between them. It was on a starless night when he, with all his strength, like one completing a centuries-long exodus, managed to leave his study, arriving at the courtyard downstairs. \"Perhaps speaking shall be more direct than writing,\" he said, a single bare thread of hope remaining in his heart. But his very voice seemed to stumble after the weave of his thoughts. His syllables came out disjointed and fragmentary \u2014 as if the intent behind the words had changed even as they were being said, and so they came out as mere mumbling and whimpering. \"Alas, poor old fellow! One might almost think he has been possessed!\" So said the well-dressed young folk who looked upon him with sympathy. \"But at least he still has the moon.\" They left after saying these words, leaving the researcher alone in the moon-bathed courtyard, trapped in the prison he once called a body.

Its intricate structure was formed of infinite corners, arcades, and passages, and at each corner would be hung a silver mirror with a gilded frame. It was said that the king spent 200 years (6 years more must be added if one wishes to follow the numbering of years in those days) to design this place, and when seated upon the throne, he could gaze into any mirror, and through its exquisitely planned and winding paths of light, one could glimpse any corner of his realm. Yet when she looked into the mirrors at the ends of the hallways in her dream, all she could see was a blurry image: that of a masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, wearing lovely ornaments, walking through the opulent corridors, like a heat haze in the flaming gold of day. She knew then her purpose, though it might seem strange \u2014 she wished to gain an audience with that king and tell him something, for these words had been put into her heart and were not hers to command, though she would always leave those words somewhere in the warping mirror-lights each time she awoke with a start.

One day, the great mage discovered clues to reaching that distant kingdom at last. Forsaking all that the worldly might hold dear, she set out on her journey alone. Across mottled moonlight she sailed, through the shadowed valleys she strode, and the darkest forests she braved, until she, at last, reached that realm of her dreams. But alas, alas! That city had been annihilated in a terrible fire a few hundred years ago, and the once-prosperous kingdom was now no more. It is just as the poets say:  </p> <p>The morning breeze is forgotten by all, Song and color have faded from sight. Only the dim gleam of towers tall, Lights the ruined, barren night.  </p> <p>She entered the devastated palace and walked amidst its ruins. The mirrors and their gilded frames had long been shattered, with naught but their shattered wrack remaining, each splinter reflecting a beam of chilling moonlight. The court was not as bizarre or strange as it had been in her dreams \u2014 in a few mere corners and a few corridors, she was knocking on the door of the throne room. It was a circular hall with hundreds of mirrors hanging from the stone walls \u2014 though like the mirrors in the hallways, these had also mostly been destroyed. The mage subconsciously walked towards that long-vacated throne and sat down, casting her gaze upon one of the still-whole mirrors. In that mirror, she beheld again that masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, walking amidst the opulent halls, and behind her, the mirrors \u2014 mirrors that had never been shattered \u2014 reflected a thousand reflections of her form. She startled and raised her head, for that young woman now stood before her, silently watching, unimaginable pain in her eyes. The mage had only just thought of something to say when the woman drew a dagger \u2014 before stabbing her in the heart. A lustrous rose-bloom graced the silent tip of the blade as flames ignited all around them, consuming the hall that had once been destroyed by a great blaze once more. She smiled in confusion, astonishment, and relief, for the woman then took her mask off, revealing the features of the mage herself, dry lips quivering ever so slightly. This time, the mage could finally hear the other person's words \u2014 words that had become lost across the decades and centuries within this labyrinthine dream and its eventide bewilderment.

As they fly in the forest, iridescent hues dance on their spread wings, and their chatters echo round the tree crowns. But these creatures are not alone, for an old and frail man dressed in tattered rags always comes and spends all day chasing after them like a savage. Just as how a towering tree was once tender and delicate, the old man used to be fair and handsome. He grew up in a village by the forest. Agile and kind, he was much-loved by all. Every girl in the village adored him, but his heart fluttered only for his love, a young priestess serving in the forest who always fascinated him with miracles of the divine. The young man often thought that he would give up anything to be with the girl, until death did them part. Alas, that which is sweet never lasts. A grueling war broke out, and the young were conscripted, including the man. Before he left for the battlefield, he saw his love weep for the first time. Teardrops rolled down her cheeks like dew falling from a green leaf \u2014 then down into his heart. Yet little did he know the actual reason behind the girl's melancholia. He made hasty promises, wishing to ease the girl's sorrow \u2014 one caused by departure, as he then naively believed. With grief written all over her face, the girl gave no response to his beautiful vows. After a brief silence, she said she would send talking birds to relay her words of longing. It was an unusual use of power, but the young man took her act as a means to secure his love. So he nodded. The young man departed the next day to honor his duty to his kingdom. It would soon be over, he thought. But reality eventually proved him wrong \u2014 the war dragged on and on. It was not until stubble grew on his chin and his eyes and hands became battle-hardened that the dust finally settled. His only solace in this brutal war was the birds from his hometown. As if guided by the gods, they always managed to come to him on quiet nights, carrying her words \u2014 the whispers of her bitter-sweet longing, telling him of changes in the village, or of a few short verses she wrote him. The sustained separation had not diminished his love for her. Instead, if love was a monument, it would be driven into his heart. When the war finally ended, he hurried home to propose to his beloved, only to find that she had died of an acute illness on a cold night shortly after his departure. The young man refused to accept it, for he had just been visited by a talking bird the previous day, when his young priestess read him beautiful prose through its mouth. He broke into the girl's closed chamber. But as the sunlight filled the dim room, it stirred what was inside: countless enchanted birds waiting to be awakened from their rich slumber. In a single instant, the birds rushed past him, wings flapping by his ears, and flew through the open door into the sky like an ethereal cloud, returning to their home. At last, the young man stood alone, his love's empty room before him. It finally dawned on him why the girl had made that most unusual arrangement with that saddened expression on her face the night they parted. It had been an arrangement for a lifetime \u2014 on her dying bed, she must have taught the birds countless words, more than enough to fill his every night since with a flicker of light. Birds live far longer than humans think. From that day on, the young man has been chasing the talking birds in the forest. In their voices, he seeks to catch her lingering soul, to repent for his sin of scattering her love in the woods. Maddened yet tireless, the young man has not stopped his chase for a single day as he turned into a middle-aged man, then aged into an old man. The talking birds now speak of nothing new, and their numbers have dwindled. But what if there is still one that he has not yet met \u2014 one with something from her that he has not yet known? The obsession traps the bird chaser in the forest, and upon his face is written the toll of years. He skillfully sets up traps very catch the birds and keeps them in a cage, stroking their necks, playing with them, and giving them the best cereals and clearest water. Then, he will say to them, \"Speak, Talking Birds, speak of my love, who the forest favored so dearly. Speak of what she taught you.\" And so, the generously-fed birds will tell such a story...</p>"},{"location":"books/Sumeru/An_Ode_to_Khvarena/","title":"An Ode to Khvarena","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Lore reportedly passed down within a lost religious group in the desert.

I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.  </p> <p>O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers.

For not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies shall erode their forms.  </p> <p>O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth. Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering. In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things. The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds.  </p> <p>O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above. The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded, The legacy of Dahri, too, has submitted to the law.

The structure of the so-called \"sacred lotus\" is similar to the composition of mine and Jakob's bodies... yet it has almost no common properties with that of Mr. Karl. A strange result, one that will require more data samples to verify... the Shamaniyya won't let us take any samples. How churlish... ...We ate dried bread. The jam is nearly gone...  </p> <p>...Compared to the powers of the Elements, the power of Khvarena is actually more similar to \u2588\u2588... It assimilates whatever materials and energies it comes into contact with... though the Khvarena is opposed to the energy of \u2588\u2588, it does similarly have a form of self-recognition. On this point, the two possess the same properties... just as tinctures of mercury will not mix with water, but will do so with other... ...We can reasonably infer that the power of Khvarena might be the same as the power of \u2588\u2588... the result of being projected onto this world. Perhaps it is precisely because of such thinking that those petty Shamaniyya came up with the notion of \"conflict\"... More importantly, we might be able to combine Khaenri'ahn records to deduce their world-formula based on this... ...There was much to consider today, so I decided to eat a couple more sweets. Finished off the jam...  </p> <p>...He sometimes cries in secret. It's understandable, I think. All my teeth have come in, so I'm an adult now, but he's only just had his third tooth come in... This would normally be time for afternoon tea at the Institute. At the moment, I don't know what Alain... ...I told him that the Vice Director said she would definitely return. She's amazing, always keeps her word, and is an adult who never tricks children. But seeing all of this, I am starting to think that she will be unable to return. Jakob has certainly thought this too. ...Split the last of the jam between myself and Jakob...  </p> <p>...Based on the Khaenri'ahn records, this place produces \"Azosite\" (a block of energy of some kind). It is certainly convenient, and at least appears to be relatively stable and safe... It seems that the original plan was to use it as the power source for some sort of agricultural machine... ...Though the results are nothing impressive, this is because the object they chose was pure elemental force, which lacks any will whatsoever. Like the difference between the Director and a Hydro Slime, perhaps? Based on her nature, she shouldn't die. At least, I hope not...  </p> <p>...So weak. If we don't take any measures, it's unlikely that we will endure long enough to return to Fontaine... ...Should be able to use this power... furious. But it's understandable, given that even homes this far apart have been flooded, an attitude of resistance to this kind of power is normal. But we must preserve Jakob's life. After all, the Narzissenkreuz Institute... ...Lost consciousness... But I do not think power can be classified as right or wrong. Adults are too pedantic... ...only remembered I hadn't eaten. Today's meal was only dried bread without jam...  </p> <p>...Regained consciousness... Jakob forgot, so Mr. Karl became suspicious, but the fake journal should still be effective for now... ...Intriguing data was gained during the process... based on the documents left behind by the Khaenri'ahns and this data, we can obtain some of the formulae... ...To celebrate and help Jakob supplement his nutritional intake (even though there's no need, I already told him that we must keep up the ruse), Mr. Karl foraged some nuts. We boiled them down into jam, which used up our remaining sugar. But that's fine. If things go to plan, we can return soon...  </p> <p>...Can be deduced all the way until the second flood period's (I've decided to call the previous incident that flooded the courtyard the first flood period, so as to better separate the two! The names being too similar caused Jakob to input the wrong data) tail end... ...Though I don't want to admit it, but no matter how many times the calculations are run, the result is the same. I cross-checked with Jakob... unbelievable. Destruction? Did I miss a variable? I must check the calculations again tomorrow...  </p> <p>...The results are as clear as a coin at the bottom of the Fountain of Lucine! Jakob also saw similar scenes... There should be a way... No, there must be a way... ...Actually thought of a possible breakthrough during the process... Even though the calculated result is unchanged, but if the refinement method is reflected... If the power of... then maybe we can extract the \"will\" within. Using this method... resist the impact...  </p> <p>...We begin our journey back to Fontaine tomorrow. This trip paid enormous dividends, and much of what was learned will be applicable... A larger catastrophe must be avoided. The plan should be fine.

He controlled the winds whistling through the desert, the dunes turned bright silver by moonlight, and the one thousand and one Jinn who hid within the night and the calls of owls.  </p> <p>They say that Al-Ahmar was a son of the sky. That is why he was known as the king of the world and received the fervent faith of countless people from the three great tribes, and was even adored by the elusive Jinn. Whenever he looked up to the sky and recalled the boundless paradise high above, and the merciless reign of thousands of years past, Al-Ahmar could not help but lower his noble head and sigh helplessly. In such moments, even the songs of the nightingale and the aroma of roses could not pull him from his sorrow.  </p> <p>The desert dwellers knew well that the ravings of nostalgia often presaged the arrival of calamity. But in that world where the wise enjoyed peace and happiness, and in the era where brave young men and women courted like lions and roses, no one foresaw the arrival of catastrophe. But how should we blame the people and spirits of the past? Even one as wise as the greatest of sages, Hermanubis, could never have known that the valiant tribe that once could equal the dragons would be reduced to corpse-eating monsters a thousand years later, and that their sullied honor and bones would be buried for eternity beneath the gilded dunes. How could he have known that the tribe of the wise, known for generations of sages, would lose our texts and become wandering bards of the desert, mourning our emperor with songs that only the Jinn understand? It is as the sages say: a mere thought can yet often bring forth calamity, if it is from the undisguised melancholy and madness of a king.  </p> <p>Thus did the three retainers of Al-Ahmar (may seven times seven curses fall upon them!) present their strategy to the king:  </p> <p>\"Your Majesty, ruler of the world, lord of the four corners of the earth, king over Jinn and mortals alike.\" The Goat King, the minister of all ministers, spoke flatteringly, \"I humbly beg your pardon if I overstep, but Your Majesty, I'm certain you are aware that indulging in dreams of old and sorrows of the past is no way to be for long. The endless power and wisdom of this land can build you a palace that surpasses the heavens, Your Majesty, and it shall bring your people a prosperous future.\"  </p> <p>\"No,\" Al-Ahmar said with a frown, and the Goat King fell silent.  </p> <p>\"Your Majesty, son of the sky, subjugator of gods, and greatest of all sages,\" The Ibis King, the scribe of all scribes, advised, \"The divine punishment of a thousand years past brought the downfall of wisdom and history. For a better future, Your Majesty, you should take control of the past. The present oases hold the wisdom of the 'present', but if we are to seize the 'past', we must act swiftly.\"  </p> <p>\"No.\" Al-Ahmar struck the ground with his staff, and the Ibis King fell silent.  </p> <p>\"Your Majesty, lord of dunes and oases, guide of the living and the dead, master of all elements.\" The Crocodile King, the commander of commanders, spoke frankly, \"If we are to recall the lost lives and welcome lost opportunities and dreams back into the fold, then this is our final chance. The greater the authority, the greater the emptiness. The greater the wisdom, the greater the sorrow. Forget the delusions of the Void. Only resurrection and life eternal can fill the endless pit of regret.\"  </p> <p>Al-Ahmar fell silent.  </p> <p>\"Fine.\"  </p> <p>The arbitrary king heeded his retainers' lies. Thus did Al-Ahmar use a hundred years and a hundred years further to build a huge maze for his kingdom, before trapping himself deep within it in search of forbidden knowledge and an elixir with which he might abandon his mortal form.  </p> <p>The subsequent events are knowledge that should not be revisited. They should be eternally forgotten by any rational history.  </p> <p>According to the legends of the desert dwellers, in just one night, the kingdom of wisdom and power was buried by the sands of retribution. They say Al-Ahmar separated his mind from his flesh and bone, placing it within the corridors, stairways, doorways, and beams that crawled eternally into the depths. It is said that Al-Ahmar's body gradually decayed on his throne while worms feasted on it, and that his soul merged into one with the wailing souls of the millions in his kingdom, doomed to wander, lost amidst the howling end, traveling along the dark and winding corridors, growing ever closer to the bottomless abyss...  </p> <p>Thus did the minds of millions merge into one, a lone soul that would eventually succumb to madness. And so, Al-Ahmar's kingdom was built and destroyed by his own hand.  </p> <p>They say that when that night came, the desert quaked, and the walls of Al-Ahmar's royal city collapsed. One thousand and one pillars trembled before the gale, and the bulls and griffins that once stood proudly atop them, gazing down at the lifeless dunes, now reluctantly fell into its gilded embrace. Countless people, sage or fool, hero or coward \u2014 all of them vanished within the sandstorm that night. The lucky survivors fell into eternal silence. It's said that they were made blind and mute as punishment for their sin of benefitting from forbidden knowledge. The sages say that trying to keep knowledge for yourself is ignorance, and that the punishment for ignorance is ignorance itself.  </p> <p>As for the descendants of the ignorant who have lost their history, the Eremites say:  </p> <p>We have returned from the land of the lost, The sky of the ages we have changed, Fear shall not stop us, No god shall we heed. Across the ocean of sand akin to gravel, To its end we shall sail.</p>"},{"location":"books/Sumeru/The_Saga_of_Hamavaran/","title":"The Saga of Hamavaran","text":""},{"location":"books/Sumeru/The_Saga_of_Hamavaran/#preface","title":"Preface","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The prefaces of the new light novel \"The Saga of Hamavaran,\" now combined into their own separate volume due to a business model adjustment!  </p> <p>Foreword  </p> <p>Thanks to a fruitful new writer recruitment drive and the phenomenal success of the contest \"This Novel is Amazing!\" we have received many highly original works from up-and-coming writers all over the world.

Legend has it that the world was once teeming with such Jinn. Al-Ahmar, mighty yet bewildered, seized them from the silver night winds and quicksands of the desert, the mystical swirls of the ocean, and the tinkling springs in the rainforest, and kept them in silver bottles. He was like an arrogant conqueror, and at the same time, a curious child.  </p> <p>Al-Ahmar harnessed the spirits with bridles and yokes, learned from their laments about the story of the dismal moon and the driving morning star, and built the majestic Ay-Khanoum \u2014 the \"City of Amphitheaters,\" or \"City of the Moon Maiden\" \u2014 to commemorate them. It is said to have been the city of the spirits, the paradise for migrants from the moon, gifted to them by Al-Ahmar. In return, the spirits constructed the huge doorway to his mausoleum.  </p> <p>This is the tale as the desert singers would tell it. Countless years later, Ay-Khanoum \u2014 like Saleh, the city of the valiant Thamudians, Tulaytullah, the land of the wise Tighnarians, and Orghana, the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys \u2014 has long been buried beneath heavy sands and swirling currents, as have the countless clans that inhabited it and the innumerable Jinn imprisoned in their silver magic bottles.  </p> <p>But now, let us leave the unnecessary fact-finding to one side and return to the subject...  </p> <p>Fifteen years after Port Ormos was built, a young shepherd found a silver bottle in the Gravelsong Dunes (Note 1). Whether out of childish curiosity or a recklessness uncharacteristic of desert dwellers, the boy broke the seal beneath the silver bottle and opened it beneath the moonlight. (Note 2)  </p> <p>\"The ravens of the mortal world are so exceptionally noisy...\" A Jinni arose from within the bottle (Note 3) in the form of a dancer, as flexible and languid as a cat and as bright and beautiful as a water lily. \"Ravens...?\" The youth was clueless, as he did not resemble a bird, nor was he noisy. \"Yes, ravens.\" The spirit repeated, rather impatiently. \"Birds that live fast and die fast, a noisy lot and no mistake... 'Only when they die do they wake up.' What about this is there to not understand, hmm?\" The young man shook his head in confusion, bringing a sigh to the spirit's lips. \"Listen, foolish bird.\" The spirit shook her head, her myrrh-scented braids swaying gently in the moonlight, the golden bells dangling at their ends ringing dreamily, but her amber eyes glinting like daggers.  </p> <p>\"I will allow you to ask three questions under three conditions...\" \"First, do not defame my lord Al-Ahmar. This is my bottom line. (Note 4)\" \"Second, harbor you no arrogance. Short-lived mortals should know where they stand.\" \"Third, do not pry into the affairs of heaven and earth. Know this: there are indeed brave guardians and splendid stars in heaven.\" \"If you fail to comply, I will fly into your mouth and nose on the night wind, like the three moon goddesses on their steeds, draw out your guts and soul, and make your lifeless flesh my new home.\"  </p> <p>The youngster hastened to cover his mouth and nose, nodding profusely to show that he understood the conditions.  </p> <p>\"Then ask, beloved child of my lord, slave of heaven.\" Said the spirit, chuckling. The bright moonlight fell on her braids, and flowed into her nearly transparent skin, granting it a crystalline sheen. \"Who are you?\" The young man asked. \"I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort...\" The spirit held her head up high with pride, letting moonlight flow through her translucent body, her golden bells ringing in the desert wind. \"As a descendant of Liloufar, I can be big or small. I can rise or hide. My kindred may be found in the waves, in the night wind, or in the pale light of the dead moon. In short, I'm a spirit, and I'm proud of who I am.\" \"Then why are you in this bottle?\" The young man shook the silver bottle in his hand and asked uncomprehendingly. \"My lord Al-Ahmar aspired to conquer the world. All mountains and seas would be his to command. To this end, he made us magic bottles of silver and stamped his mark on us, and so we became his servants, engaging in noble deeds of creation and exploration. In other words... we were not servants in shame, but servants with pride.\" \"But afterwards...\" The spirit said quietly, her amber eyes darkening. \"My lord brought disaster upon himself, leaving us sentenced to generations of oblivion. We were trapped in sealed silver bottles, drowning in dreams until the moment of our death.\"  </p> <p>\"Well, your third question, then!\" The spirit waved her hand briskly, causing a clear jingle of the ancient silver coins adorning her wrists. \"Have a care for your query, or your mouth and nose will suffer!\" \"So...\" The young man hesitated for a moment, and asked the last question. \"What's it like to live in a bottle?\"  </p> <p>Seemingly having never heard of such a question before, the spirit was slightly surprised before she answered slowly.  </p> <p>\"In the first era, I lived in a carefree palace, singing with nightingales and talking with roses. It was a beautiful time, a time when poets and lovers were born because of me. In those days, it seemed that the entire City of the Moon Maiden was in the bottle, and even the tasteless spring water was intoxicating.\" \"At that time, I told myself that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would curse and kill them.\"  </p> <p>\"In the era that came after, sandstorms and demons ran riot. Nightingales sang till their voice grew raspy and their blood dried up. Roses withered and turned into tangles of thorns. Poets died of maltreatment, lovers were displaced, prosperity vanished... It was a dreadful time when everything came to a standstill in the eternal collapse. Yet likewise, the City of the Moon Maiden seemed to be right in the bottle.\" \"So I told myself that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would fight against its injustice.\"  </p> <p>\"Then in the third era, everything was reduced to dust. The grand play of the City of the Moon Maiden came to an end, and what remained were the ruined theater and the wrecked masks of the gods. In that era, I ran out of tears to shed, and the chiming golden bells and the fluttering veil became to me a haunting curse.\" \"And so, I told myself amidst that desolation that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would turn into an evil seeking revenge \u2014 I would destroy the world, or else destroy myself.\"  </p> <p>\"So...\" A gust of cold wind in the desert sent a shiver over the young man, causing him to tighten his loose robe.  </p> <p>\"Yes, I could have made you the first target of my revenge... tore your bones and flesh to make a cruel song of your soul.\" The spirit smiled teasingly, like a nightingale announcing a death on a summer night. \"Yet the dead moon cast a glow over the quicksand dunes, and over me... and I suddenly realized how lovely the world is.\" \"And so this poor Jinni, like a chick struggling to break through its egg, has hopelessly fallen in love with this barren and ravaged world and its circle of life and death. The proud Jinni, once nourished by the delicacies of roses, has fallen for the land infested with toads and vipers...\" \"It all makes me wonder what it will be like... when the 'raven' becomes the 'groom.'\"  </p> <p>\"So...?\" The youngster cowered again.  </p> <p>\"So, tell me a story, little raven. Let me see the world.\" The spirit grinned slyly at the sight of the youth's puzzled look, her golden bells tinkling at the end of her braids.  </p> <p>And so, the spirit of the moon maiden's city once again embarked on her journey around the world.  </p> <p>Footnotes: 1.

The moonlit silver coins jangled on her wrists and ankles as if displeased with the jouncing of the Sumpter Beast. \"Anyway, little raven, do you know the meaning of the name \"Shiruyeh\"?\"  </p> <p>\"Uh... 'One who is ridiculous and despicable'?\" The youth whom she had rather one-sidedly named \"Raven\" answered casually. Suffering the heat of the sun and the threat of quicksand, he had little interest in his travel companion's stories. \"In our tribe, 'Shiruyeh' is a disgraceful name branded only onto the foreheads of exiled chiefs and spoken only in curses and mockery.

As the spirits tell it, he was an orphan who was raised in the nest of the giant bird Ghoghnus and given the name 'Kisra,' or 'one who has been bestowed a good name.' Later, his aspiration to greatness and the aid of this divine bird saw him adopted by the vassal king Ormazd Shah, and he would eventually rise to become a sage and hero among mortals.  </p> <p>In the songs of the now-vanished desert people, Kisra plundered the four corners of the land in the name of his king, Ormazd Shah. By his hand, the bronze and mortar towers of ninety-nine cities were destroyed or abandoned. By his hand, the leaders of ninety-nine nomadic tribes were defeated. And by his hand, ninety-nine sages with knowledge of the order of the stars were bound in golden chains, then led back to the towering royal city of Gurabad to be imprisoned.  </p> <p>At that time, the promised land of \"Valivija\" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.  </p> <p>Returning to our preceding tale, Ormazd's crown grew all the more valuable on the back of Kisra's exploits, until finally his own neck could no longer bear its weight, forcing him to leave it ever suspended from chains of pure gold in the center of the main hall.  </p> <p>The vassal king Ormazd Shah rewarded young Kisra's unrivaled achievements amply: He bestowed the name \"Parvez\" upon his adopted son and offered his daughter Shirin's hand to him in marriage. In the ethereal songs of the spirits, as the heir of both the mortal vassal king and the foremother Liloufar, she possessed superior wisdom and was blessed with an infinite lifespan and, like the original sages, could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of the present moment.  </p> <p>If Kisra Parvez had stopped there, his reputation as a hero would have continued unblemished. But one cursed day, Ormazd and all 300 of his offspring suddenly died in one night in the city of Gurabad. Following such an unthinkable event, the throne naturally fell to Kisra, who added \"Ravan\" to his title and became the most powerful vassal king among mortals.  </p> <p>\"...\"  </p> <p>The fairy abruptly stopped her tale and looked up at the red sun that was now sinking behind the sand dunes. She then whistled sharply, signaling to the youth to halt the Sumpter Beast and prepare to make camp for the night under the crumbling stone pillars.  </p> <p>\"Some people say...\" The fairy lithely leaped down from the Sumpter Beast and circled across the sands in a manner not unlike the long-lost dancers of Setaria, letting the moon's first light evenly coat her translucent skin in its silvery sheen. The scent of myrrh swirled around her myriad braids as the golden bells rang out into the distance. Then, the fairy leaned over slightly, balancing on the tips of her toes as she laughed softly.  </p> <p>Some people say that the tragedy that befell the city of Gurabad was the handiwork of the hero Kisra. Some people say that the night the tragedy took place, an evil, clawless bird flew out from the redoubt and wailed throughout the night without stopping to eat or drink. The castle was then struck by a plague of rats with human faces, which gnawed at the gold chains from which the crown hung, causing the cumbersome thing to crash heavily to the ground, broken and bent. People say that the crown made such an earth-shaking noise when it fell that even the Fellahin servants, who had settled and toiled far from the redoubt, trembled with fear at this tyrant they had never met. Later still, it is said that an adventurer found the ancient crypts of the city of Gurabad beneath the gilded sands, in which were hidden the withered, massive remains of Ormazd and his offspring, An ancient, inscrutable inscription was left on each of the shriveled bodies...  </p> <p>\"I hope this story frightened you.\" The fairy watched keenly as the mortal boy before her drank from the waterskin. The tribes of the desert regard water with an instinctive restraint and prudence. Spirits, however, are born of pure elemental energy and know neither thirst nor the satisfaction of the pleasure of luxury, just like the ancient princess Shirin in this lament.  </p> <p>\"As for the daughter of the foremother Liloufar I mentioned, Shirin \u2014 why, our story has only just begun...\" The fairy smiled slyly again, her eyes like an amalgam of amber and gold, her smiling face like the princess of her ancient homeland.  </p>"},{"location":"books/Sumeru/The_Tale_of_Shiruyeh_and_Shirin/#vol-2","title":"Vol. 2","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A Jinni tells a tale on the night wind, a story about itself and a shepherd.

Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.  </p> <p>\"Yes, you've mentioned this part of the story already.\" The youth's tone was rather impatient as he gazed at the full moon hanging in the starry sky, using the positions of its companion stars to determine the next day's route. But the spirit knew that he was, in truth, listening earnestly to her story. She couldn't refrain from letting out a triumphant snort, but was immediately annoyed by this unbecoming action: \"The mortal mind is as fickle as it is forgetful. How should I know whether you were listening or not?\"  </p> <p>Back to the subject at hand \u2014 Shirin, according to the spirits' lamentations, was the daughter of the mortal hero Ormazd and the fairy Liloufar, the Daughter of the Water Lily. Born upon a lily pad amid fragrant dewdrops, the white ibis blessed her, and the cobra bequeathed to her a cerulean pearl, and even the mighty giant crocodile bowed to her in worship. As the foremother of the spirits, before she delivered her daughter to the mortal vassal king, Liloufar prophesied three times: First, that Shirin would fall in love with a great hero, and the progeny of their union would surpass their father. Second, that many of Shirin's relatives would enjoy a sweet end, and third, that Shirin alone would be given possession of her father's kingdom. Then, Liloufar gave three admonitions to her mortal darling: First, that her joy would bring tears to her father's eyes. Second, that they should no longer feast at the same table as their daughter after she was wed, and third, that their daughter's heir would be an ill omen upon the king's land.  </p> <p>The king, however, only smiled at these prophecies and admonitions.  </p> <p>\"Later, Shirin's father offered her hand in marriage to the great hero 'Parvezravan,' fulfilling the first prophecy, right?\" The youth said, interrupting the spirit's story.  </p> <p>\"That's correct, though, not entirely so...\" The spirit laid a finger on the tip of the youth's nose and the latter hurriedly moved away, his face flushed as if he feared she might put some ethereal, deathly curse on him. The spirit once again found herself amused by such an innocent act.  </p> <p>By the time Shirin grew a little older and more cognizant, the vision her mother laid out for her became a lingering curse. She spent her days awaiting her chance to fall in love with a hero, waiting for the day when she would inherit her father's kingdom, and longing for that sweet and perfect future \u2014 but it never came.  </p> <p>Truth be told, Shirin's marriage to the hero Kisra was not a happy one \u2014 after all, mortal heroes are all warped people harboring the ambition to rule. The daughter of Liloufar carried the pride of the spirits, and thus she found the golden trap of the mortal hero's supposed affections hard to endure, and she found no peace between the bed and the hearth. And so at last, a vivid hatred coalesced from this passionless, dull, rotten life \u2014 the same hatred that those imprisoned in the silver bottle carry.  </p> <p>Later, on the night of the infamous grand banquet, a few lowly slaves \u2014 mages of the Mazandaran Oasis, or perhaps some illiterate Fellahin servants \u2014 dripped scorpion venom into musk honey and offered it to the vassal king Ormazd and his 300 heirs. They then watched as they sunk into the sweet, dreamless landscape of death, drowning in the fat and blood of the wretched as their blood and tears flowed freely... And on this night, all who remained with dreams left to enjoy were Shirin, who had been excluded from the party by her own father, and her reluctant co-conspirator and husband, Kisra. The lowly regicides were thereupon submerged in the honey pot as punishment by the new king, and they cursed him with their last breaths as they choked on the sticky honey. And from the new king's mouth gushed blackened, dirtied, and bloodied lies, which gradually stained his hero's reputation a deep black... And so, the second prophecy was fulfilled.  </p> <p>Later, Shiruyeh, the son of Kisra Parvezravan, grew to adulthood beloved by his mother, but was banished by his father from the towering city of Gurabad. Made by his father to hide his face and flee on a fast steed, Shiruyeh was henceforth forbidden from setting foot in the city again. Undoubtedly terrified of the fairy-mother Liloufar's warning, it was Parvezravan's fixation that gave rise to the cowardice that spurred this decision. And so, Shirin once again found the perfect opportunity for revenge in the vassal king's unfettered fear.  </p> <p>One night, she disguised herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess and met with her prodigal son who had sojourned there. In the lingering silvery light that danced amidst the dew-dotted lilies, she gave the masked wayfarer this false, illusory prophecy: \"Is the tyranny of the wanderer's father not his greatest misfortune? O darling of the moon goddess, everywhere the moonlight touches is yours to rule, and every seed you sow shall grow and flourish. Since the moonlight has granted you a good bow and a sharp blade, why do you suffer that coward idling upon the throne? Why not muster up the courage to face your hatred, to face yourself?\" Legend has it that just as Shiruyeh hesitated in indecision, a gust of wind rushed through the night and blew the veil Shirin had used to conceal her face away. Seeing that familiar face, the young man who had been forced to cover his was instantly overcome with terror and shame. He fled the sullied temple in a panic, and laughter soft as the ringing of a bell and the cruel moonlight bore witness to his fear.  </p> <p>The story from here is a lackluster one: The peerless vassal king \"Parvezravan\" would be stabbed to death in his bed by his own masked, unfilial son, and his magnificent bed \u2014 once adorned with sapphire and golden animal horns \u2014 would be indelibly stained with his blood. The dirge of the spirits then goes like this: After committing this crime of treason, Shiruyeh wept bitterly before his mother Shirin in repentance. But Shirin did not reprimand him. Rather she took her beloved son into her arms, removed the brass mask symbolizing his exile, and left him with an affectionate kiss of benediction.  </p> <p>After Shiruyeh claimed the throne, he was long tormented by inescapable nightmares until finally, on a frenzied night of wandering, he fell into a deep black chasm in the earth and disappeared. Later, a great plague emerged from that chasm and swallowed up half of the souls in the city of Gurabad. The kingdom, having lost its vassal king and his servants, fell into ruin and was gradually devoured by that insatiable yellow sand. The scattered survivors of this calamity called it \"Shiruyeh's Plague\" \u2014 the divine retribution invited by the absurdly short-lived despot himself.  </p> <p>As for his mother Shirin, Liloufar's third prophecy was indeed fulfilled \u2014 She and the heir she bore won true freedom in a kingdom ravaged by vengeance, and they became evil apparitions, death knells to the conceited.  </p> <p>\"Some people say that Shirin was later subdued by my lord Al-Ahmar, who detained her in a magic silver bottle. Others say that she still roams the desert, tormenting overconfident adventurers and tirelessly searching for the beloved child that she lost to that dark world...\" The fairy smiled proudly, having theatrically concluded the story. At this time, the moon was already high in the sky, and the distant, ancient time when the desert had not yet become a desert was nigh. It was time for the divine princess to hold the sacrifice.</p>"},{"location":"notes/","title":"List of all the Books","text":"<ul> <li>Mondstadt:<ul> <li>Lost Adventure Notebook</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/Mondstadt/Lost_Adventure_Notebook/","title":"Lost Adventure Notebook","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>A set of adventurer's notes that you picked in the ruins.
